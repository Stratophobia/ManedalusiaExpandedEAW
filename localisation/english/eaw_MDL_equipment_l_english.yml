###GUNS###
  MDL_melee_equipment_0:0 "Manedalusian Swords"
  MDL_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Swords"
  MDL_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "Since the time the venerable Sultans of Everleaf ruled from Coltoba, Manedalusian weaponsmiths made distinct blades fitted for swift strikes on heavy charges. Though long since made largely obsolete on the battlefield, it is still common to see an army officer or public official bearing an older scimitar as a sign of authority. It may also be used for dueling, and if nothing else, should industrial manufacturing falter, a sword is better than bare hooves even on the modern battlefield."
  MDL_melee_equipment_1:0 "'Al-Ramd' Musket"
  MDL_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "Affectionately nicknamed al-Ramd, \"The Smoky\", this unreliable and relatively ineffective barebones musket model was the official weapon of choice for the Manedalusian occupation garrison during the last years of the Abyssinian administration. It's prone to jamming, inaccurate even when compared to similarly aged foreign models, and produces a big cloud of dark smoke upon firing; hence its moniker. While it was standard issue for many years, garrison troops were known to often rely on traditional swords as an effective sidearm when Smoky couldn't be expected to perform properly."
  MDL_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Al-Ramd"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Zafira Model 02"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Zafira"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Zafira Model line was nothing short of a godsend for Manedalusia, designed in secrecy by the mercantile guilds of Coltoba. While no miracle of engineering, the Zafira is cheap, effective, and vastly superior to the \"Smoky\" muskets the garrison was forced to use before its introduction."
  MDL_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Al-Jawad Carbine"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Al-Jawad"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Al-Jawad has the distinct honor of being the very first independent national arms project undertaken in Manedalusia since its newfound independence. The basis for the model are the myriad foreign surplus models that found their way onto the hooves of Hashm Koltāliba Order members. It's a reliable bolt-action rifle with a decent rate of fire and ease of reload, a perfect fit for a newly industrializing army."
  MDL_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Mon Ami Pattern LMG"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Mon Ami"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Named in honor of Admiral Jean-Claude, the Mon Ami pattern is an effective light machine gun that allows troops to maintain a sustained wall of fire on the move. It packs a decent punch, is easy enough to carry and maintain, has compact and light ammunition, and can be relied on to keep firing even in the heaviest sandstorm."
  MDL_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Everleaf Pattern Battle Rifle"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Everleaf"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "This newest pattern of heavy-duty battle rifles provides increased firepower, increased accuracy, and the ability to provide consistent suppressing fire. Belt-fed variants also make defending stationary positions much easier, and allow soldiers to bunker down and hold their ground against enemy charges and disable lightly armored vehicles."
  MDL_infantry_equipment_x:0 "Stargazer Model K-12"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_x_short:0 "Stargazer K-12"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "A deviation from previous models, the Stargazer pattern assault rifle is much lighter and easier to carry, providing great value in close-quarters combat while also maintaining reasonable firepower and effective range. Combined with perfected squad tactics, a unit armed with Stargazers can perfectly fit all roles from garrison duty to heavy assault troops."
  MDL_infantry_equipment_x_2:0 "Stargazer Model X-11"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_x_2_short:0 "Stargazer X-11"
  MDL_infantry_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "The Stargazer model line has been perfected to such an extent it's made bolt-action rifles obsolete outside of specialized unit roles. A light frame combined with an extended arsenal of accessories have made the rank-and-file soldier a force to be reckoned with in their own right, fitted for versatility in all roles."
  MDL_magical_equipment_1:0 "Moonstriker Prototype"
  MDL_magical_equipment_1_short:0 "Moonstriker"
  MDL_magical_equipment_1_desc:0 "Moonstriker Laylah's passion for alchemical experimentation and magitek are not merely hobbies. Cooperating with the League for resources and funding, she is largely responsible for designing this functional magical rifle prototype."
  MDL_magical_equipment_2:0 "Moonstriker C-37"
  MDL_magical_equipment_2_short:0 "Moonstriker C-37"
  MDL_magical_equipment_2_desc:0 "It took the alchemist mare many tries to produce a functional iteration of her original design, but her work has paid off tremendously. The C-37 Moonstriker model is a more reliable, more accurate and much more powerful magical rifle fit for mass production."
  MDL_magical_equipment_3:0 "Avenger Pattern LMG"
  MDL_magical_equipment_3_short:0 "Avenger"
  MDL_magical_equipment_3_desc:0 "While Moonstriker perfected bolt-action single fire magical models, al-Neighzari's assistance in creating functional reusable cartridges has allowed for the creation of a fast firing automatic design of magical rifles. The result is a powerful and devastating light machine gun."
  MDL_magical_equipment_4:0 "Sunlight Pattern Heavy Machine Gun"
  MDL_magical_equipment_4_short:0 "Sunlight"
  MDL_magical_equipment_4_desc:0 "The pinnacle of magical rifle technology, the Sunlight pattern is an improvement upon the original Avenger model, with a focus on sustained firepower at the cost of subtlelty and ease of carry. Powerful enough to punch a hole straight through infantry helms and even vehicle plating, the Sunlight machine gun is an unwieldy beast capable of unprecedented destruction."

  MDL_nav_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Empyrean Pattern Naval Bomber"
  MDL_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Empyrean"
  MDL_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Clover based this model on the one she first fell prey to the whims of passion on, apparently. Best not to voice that outside of military circles. The Mufti would certainly not approve."
  MDL_nav_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Empyrean C12 Model"
  MDL_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Empyrean C12"
