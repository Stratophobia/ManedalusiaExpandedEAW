  manedalusia.1.t:0 "The Manedalusia Coup"
  manedalusia.1.d:0 "How it was possible, no one in the royal court was quite sure. Gomez was only informed of the matter when a message reached Panthera from Basha Bingus. Some could scarcely believe it at first; the introduction of slavery in the region had made Manedalusia an unstable and unruly province, certainly, but it seemed as if things were under control.\n\nThen the flotilla came into the Coltoba harbor. No one could deny the reality at that point; this was no mindless civilian or slave uprising. This was a full blown coup.\n\nAbyssinian forces scrambled for a swift response, and the King, despite his attempt to remain composed, seemed to be mentally absent at best. He rubbed his eyes with his paw, and meekly, he managed to convey a command to mobilize the armed forces at once. Alas, the Manedalusians had caught Abyssinia in a moment of weakness; with most of the army stationed westward, keeping a close eye over things in Katren, only Bingus' personal garrison was in a position to act swiftly, before the Manedalusian ponies could establish control."
  manedalusia.1.a:0 "The bulk of the Abyssinian Army makes it just in time."
  manedalusia.1.b:0 "Bingus ruthlessly crushes the rebellion."
  manedalusia.1.c:0 "Bingus is dead... they killed him!"
  manedalusia.1.dd:0 "Praise be to the Heavens! The Sultanate is not yet lost!"
  manedalusia.2.t:0 "The Council Gathers"
  manedalusia.2.d:0 " The Neighdinat Al-Zahra, the fortified citadel from where the old Sultans of Al-Manedalus once ruled their domain, was abuzz with activity. Military personnel were assigned to every entry, and inside, the generals responsible for Manedalusia's independence met. All of them knew well how dire their predicament was, and the necessity of quick, effective action. A political direction would have to be decided at once, as Manedalusia could ill afford internal divisions in this time of strife.\n\n Among Coltoba's populace and the military staff, there was discussion on whether Al-Manedalus could be restored under its traditional historical institutions. If so, the absolute rule of the Sultans would have to be reconciled with the later authority of the Majlis Ash-Shūrā. For now, with neither a Sultan nor an elected Senate, the Council's government lacked legitimacy.\n\n There was also the pro-Harmony mare, Velvet Qamar. The generals were well aware of the Coltoba populist, and her ideas were getting at least some amount of attention among the capital's growing middle class. If Manedalusia was to join the modern world with renewed strength, perhaps Velvet's platform of national kinship and decentralized governance, in the style of the Equestrian principality, was exactly what they needed.\n\n There was also the option that none dared speak of. Asserting control outside the capital, with their ragtag army, would be a challenge. Rural populism could be the option to win the day, especially if the Council relied on Manedalusia's last unifying force, its shared faith.\n\nAnd lastly... the Griffon. From the guard high tower in the palace complex, one could see the battleship and its flotilla in the harbor. Everypony in the Council was well aware of the eccentric Grifo, and as it stood, he was likely the most powerful creature in Coltoba outside the military government. His ships were covered in rust, with visible damage to the hulls, and the madgriff was not kind to anypony who asked where he got hold of them. To the Council's shame, that barely functional fleet was the most valuable military asset in Manedalusia, and the Sultanate simply could not stand such a rogue element in Coltoba. Grifo is clearly biding his time, but to what end?"
  manedalusia.2.a:0 "We must act fast."
  manedalusia.3.t:0 "The Madgriff in the Harbor"
  manedalusia.3.d:0 "Khaldun found Sayf still atop the guard tower. He appeared lost in thought as he stared out to the harbor, but quickly recomposed himself.\n\n\"Has he forwarded any messages?\"\n\n\"No.\", Khaldun responded, taking note of his colleague's frown. \"Our intelligence personnel have confirmed the fleet sailed from Tobuck three days before the coup.\"\n\nSayf's gaze narrowed. \"They knew.\"\n\nKhaldun nodded. \"What are you thinking, Crimson?\"\n\nThe stallion took a second of silence to think, but quickly retorted: \"If he was here to negotiate a deal, he'd have said something already. His help against Abyssinia seems entirely incidental, if you ask me.\"\n\nKhaldun nodded in agreement. \"Perhaps we could convince the others to stage a raid.\" The thought quickly grabbed Sayf's attention. \"Under the cover of night. We'd strike swiftly, before he can react.\"\n\nCrimson was quick to smile and agree, but he added: \"We can only hope they'll see reason. I don't think any good could come of attempting a more amicable approach.\"\n\nAs the two most prestigious generals in the Council, Khaldun and Sayf's shared word could easily sway the others. Still, it was in the Council's hooves whether they would attempt to negotiate."
  manedalusia.3.a:0 "We will raid the fleet under the cover of night."
  manedalusia.3.b:0 "Perhaps Grifo can still be reasoned with."
  manedalusia.4.t:0 "Grifo's Fleet Is Raided"
  manedalusia.4.d:0 "Manedalusian forces only had access to barebones civilian vessels and small rafts, but it was more than enough to bring ponies aboard Grifo's ships under the cover of night. Once aboard, kill squads were quick to take control of the main decks and storm the crew quarters.\n\nThere were a few casualties as the predominantly griffon crew scrambled for their weapons and to alert each other, but they were quickly overwhelmed and either killed or taken for interrogation.\n\nAs for Grifo himself, the madgriff's screams could be heard all across his battleship's deck when he was awoken. He swiftly flew down, pistol in claw, and shot a soldier before being shot down himself. Even as he struggled to breathe when landing with a thud, he continued to fire, forcing the soldiers to kill him. Whatever it was the griffon had in mind for Manedalusia, he died filled with rage and conviction.\nBe it as it may, we have successfully secured Grifo's naval assets for ourselves. It's no mighty Navy, but it's a start."
  manedalusia.4.a:0 "Splendid!"
  manedalusia.5.t:0 "The Weight of Legacy"
  manedalusia.5.d:0 "As Manedalusia's government gathered its strength and tallied its scarce assets, it became increasingly apparent which faces would come to dominate the country's political direction. Should the Council come to rely on Manedalusia's historical institutions for legitimacy, the primary issue that had to be solved was the relation between the Sultan and the Majlis Ash-Shūrā.\n\nArmil Khaldun, charismatic and regal in his demeanor, presented himself as a moderate, and his position was rather unsurprising, given his background. As he saw it, the prosperity that Al-Manedalus experienced without a Sultan during the Golden Age of Sailing was proof enough of the efficacy of elective, representative institutions. If the Sultanate was to be reborn in this new age, it would have to restrict the purview of its monarch's authority and allow the Majlis Ash-Shūrā to operate as it had during that age.\n\nCrimson Sayf and the hardliners were having none of it. As they saw it, Al-Manedalus' position was too fragile to allow populists any degree of sway. The Majlis Ash-Shūrā was created as an advisory body in the High Sultanate Period, and for the nation to regain its greatness, then the wayward institution had to be restored to its rightful place of subservience to the Sultan."
  manedalusia.5.a:0 "But who shall be Sultan?"
  manedalusia.6.t:0 "The Revelation"
  manedalusia.6.d:0 "The general found himself in a chariot made of starlight riding high above the clouds, guided by a burning ember that shined in the darkness. Looking up past the celestial sphere's reach, he could see all the things that had been and would be; he saw those primordial eons of reality, when caprine demons gave birth to monstrosities of flesh and Arcana; he saw the destruction of States, the birth and death of empires, the perpetual flow of his and all other kind's strength like water flowing through a stream; and through the mists of Time he saw the echoes of that first instant, when the First Cause, the Prime Mover, who sat upon his golden throne in the darkness, opened His Eye to the world, and His mindscape rippled through the Dark until it gave birth to Matter and Spirit. The world seemed like a tiny, fragile thing in the vastness of Creation, and as the ember fell through the clouds and burned bright in red and green fire, a blinding light overwhelmed him, and for a fraction of an instant, he saw the shadow of He Who Bears Witness to All Things.\n\nSayf awoke covered in a cold sweat with shaking hooves. His heart racing, he stumbled out of bed to stare out the window to the stars above. The pain on his hind leg was as sharp as ever when he put weight on it, but in that moment, it seemed not to bother him at all. As his mind slowed to a standstill and he took a deep breath, the inky blackness of the night soothed his worries until they all but melted away; and what remained was a newly found spirit deep within him.\n\nHis purpose became apparent. The stars had aligned, and the future never seemed so clear."
  manedalusia.6.a:0 "\"I shall be Your Sword.\""
  manedalusia.7.t:0 "Swaying the Council"
  manedalusia.7.d:0 "Sayf was unsure how it was that he convinced Al-Manesūr he was not lying. His own words were lost to him. When he spoke, he did so with an unshaking certainty that came from somewhere external to him; it's as if Ash-Shahid Himself spoke through him.\n\nIn the end, swaying the Sultanate hardliners was easily done. Divine revelation or not, Crimson was the most respected military leader in the Council, and if anypony among them was to become Sultan, it should be him. The most cynical members of the Council were at the very least willing to give Sayf a chance. They would support him, and if he could deliver Al-Manedalus to glory, then perhaps the All and Ever-Witnessing had truly chosen him."
  manedalusia.7.a:0 "His Will shall be done."
  manedalusia.8.t:0 "Sayf's Speech"
  manedalusia.8.d:0 "The adorned halls of the Neighdinat Al-Zahra fell silent as Sayf passed, and soldiers saluted him and bowed their heads as he made his way to the throne room. Once inside, he greeted the other generals with a professional nod. He found himself momentarily lost in thought as he stared upon the empty throne. Its weight felt impossible to bear, and in this crucial moment, Sayf was assaulted by an inkling of doubt.\n\n\"Sir,\", came the voice of Al-Manesūr, which snapped Sayf back to reality. \"we're ready to begin the broadcast now.\"\n\nSayf took a deep breath, nodded in agreement, and made his way to the radio. As he pressed the button with his hoof, he pushed all of his doubts to the back of his mind, and spoke: "People of Coltoba! I speak to you today not just on behalf of the transitional government, but on behalf of the All and Ever-Witnessing Himself!\"\n\nSayf paused, as if feeling the whole city collectively gasp. \"Many among you may not believe me, but I have bore witness to Ash-Shahid's divine glory, and He has revealed to me the path that our nation must follow if it is to survive these coming years of strife. The military government will now begin its slow dissolution, and in its stead, the true Sultanate of Al-Manedalus shall be reforged, and I, Crimson Sayf, shall one day rise to sit upon its throne, and succeed the legendary House of Everleaf.\"\n\nThere was silent anticipation in the throne room as Sayf came to a stop again. The general frowned and grinded his teeth, staring back towards the throne for a second, before finally saying: \"I understand that I have yet to prove my worth. When our first Sultan, Al-Wallid II, seized the city of Coltoba from the infidels, he converted its inhabitants to the true faith after they witnessed him effortlessly defeat the city's garrison. Our founder proved beyond any shadow of doubt that the Hoof of Ash-Shahid guided his own, and I shall follow in his steps. As such, I promise to you all, on my honor, that I will not sit upon the throne of the Neighdinat Al-Zahra until the day I deliver victory to our nation, and prove to all of you our state shall survive and thrive. For now, steady yourselves and hold your heads high!\"\n\nSayf let go of the radio button, and stood silent, reflecting on that moment. That was it; he had taken his leap of faith, and his path had been sealed. There was now no going back: he would claim the Sultanate, or he would die trying."
  manedalusia.8.a:0 "We'll see if he is truly worthy."
  manedalusia.9.t:0 "The Quest For A Perfect Synthesis"
  manedalusia.9.d:0 "Armil Khaldun took a deep breath, and appreciated this rare moment of solitude in the throne room of the Neighdinat Al-Zahra. Sayf and the rest of the general staff were asleep, and only a select few guards were still roaming the halls in the late hours of the night. All by himself, he stared at the foreboding empty throne and up its two flanking pillars that spiraled to the ceiling, lit by the moonlight.\n\nAl-Manedalus had a rich history, but one that left Khaldun feeling an unbearably bittersweet taste. It was once a regional mercantile and military power, and perhaps if things had been different, it could've reached the great heights of Colthage in its prime. But fate was unkind to his homeland, which spent a millenium as a subjugated provincial possession of foreign despots.\n\nNot all was grim in Manedalusia's history, however. Even under the reign of Abyssinia, the light of Coltoba still shined bright in the Golden Age of Sailing, when its mercantile guilds brought great wealth to the city and Manedalusian ships were the envy of merchant fleets from Arabia to the distant reaches of Northern Zebrica. Still, even that age did not last; when the heretical Arabians conquered Eastward and declawed the Abyssinian Kingdom, Manedalusia became a poor and isolated backwater dominion of their vast imperial domain. The catfolk could not defend Coltoba; it was their weakness that allowed the coup to succeed in the first place.\n\nNow was the moment of destiny. While all of Zebrica still reeled from the shockwave of the Storm King, Khaldun's homeland stood tall and unaffected by the mad yeti, already used to hardship and strife. If Manedalusia was to survive, it needed a Sultan which could command its armies and soothe the anxieties of the faithful. Still, no Sultan should ever be so prideful as to believe he could rule alone, and the Majlis Ash-Shūrā proved their usefulness as a representative institution. With proper guidance, the martial might of the High Sultanate could be combined with the great wealth and prestige it achieved in the Golden Age. A wise pony, one aware of the mistakes of the past and the cycles of history that haunted Manedalusia's legacy, could take this downtrodden nation away from its dark millenium and towards a new dawn, in which it finally achieved its full potential.\n\nKhaldun believed himself to be such a stallion. Fortune favors the bold, and in this age of Chaos and Strife, to be indolent is to invite disaster."
  manedalusia.9.a:0 "Power is attained only by those who dare to seize it."
  manedalusia.10.t:0 "The Autocrat's Hubris"
  manedalusia.10.d:0 "\"In short, gentleponies,\" concluded Khaldun to the general staff. \"it is clear from the historical precedent that good governance, while maintained by the force of arms, is not solely based upon it. Upholding the true principles of Justice, as outlined in the Book, maintains the strength and vitality of society, and that strength can then be channeled through its army to defend the nation from threats from within and without. Relying solely on force degenerates a people's Asabiyyah, the core vitality and unity of society, and leads to decline through indolence, corruption and arrogance.\"\n\n\"What are you suggesting, Armil?\", came the reply from Moonstriker.\n\n\"I'm saying that if the nation is to survive, the health of Asabiyyah must be our primary priority. Autocratic rule, even by a well meaning leader, cannot maintain it. Only Ash-Shahid, in His infinite capability, possesses the all-encompassing knowledge needed to command all things from the top down, and even He, ever benevolent and wise, delegates His authority to the proper domains of Science, Reason and Justice. A wise leader must follow in His example.\"\n\nThere was a silent pause. Al-Manesūr seemed unconvinced, but Moonstriker, at least, had somewhat relented.\n\n\"I urge all present to make the right choice\", said Khaldun at last. \"For the sake of all our people have suffered; we cannot fail them now.\""
  manedalusia.10.a:0 "It was a close call, but Khaldun pulled it off."
  manedalusia.11.t:0 "The Populist Mares"
  manedalusia.11.d:0 "\"Are these terms to your satisfaction, miss?\", Khaldun asked with a polite smile.\n\nSunset had been much harder to work with than Velvet, which left the noble feeling somewhat drained by the end of their discussion. Still, the mare eventually listened to reason.\n\n\"I hope you understand, sir,\", Sunset warned. \"that our agreement in no way means you have our unwavering support. Still, I will relent... for now.\" Mirage made sure to glare daggers in his direction as she made her point.\n\nQamar had been watching Khaldun argue with her for a while with something of an amused expression, and when it was finally over, she approached Khaldun.\n\n\"I hope my friend wasn't too much of a bother for you, sir.\"\n\n\"She's quite... passionate about the faith, isn't she?\" asked Khaldun. \"I heard she was a Marksist in her younger years. Is that true?\"\n\nVelvet Qamar looked somewhat apprehensive at the thought. \"It's true, yes, and no pony, not even I, is quite sure why she changed her mind. It's obviously quite personal for her, though.\"\n\nNegotiations were a pain, but they would bear more than enough fruit to justify it. With the populists on his side, Khaldun now had the popular support he needed to transition smoothly into a civilian government. It would be difficult to balance the interests of the city-dwellers and the countryfolk, but for Manedalusia's sake, it had to be done in amicable terms."
  manedalusia.11.a:0 "Politics and Religion: quite the combination."
  manedalusia.12.t:0 "A New Sultanate For A New Millenium"
  manedalusia.12.d:0 "\"They will betray you\", warned Sayf as the two stallion sat alone at the top of the high guard tower.\n\n\"No pony rules alone, Crimson\", replied Khaldun. \"Al-Wallid II, peace be upon him, did not. Neither did any Sultan of Everleaf.\"\n\n\"If it's reliable allies you sought, you could've found them in the army. That's where most ponies of good character can be found.\" Sayf shot Khaldun a glare that nearly burned a whole through his skull. \"Or did you worry they'd be more loyal to me?\"\n\nArmil sighed profusely. \"Please, Sayf\", he pleaded. \"I know we've always had our differences, and I know you think me a naive bleeding heart. But if you stand by me and give me a chance, I promise I'll deliver Manedalusia the prosperity it deserves. I'll need your help.\"\n\nSayf was silent for a moment, but soon retorted with a laugh: \"You've beaten me in the race for the throne, Armil. And the homeland cannot afford a coup.\" He finally nodded in agreement. \"Very well. You'll have your chance, on the condition that you refer to me on military matters. You know as well as I do that on the battlefield, I'd have you beat any day.\"\n\nArmil was happy to hear his colleague's words, but Crimson then put on a deathly frown.\n\n\"And, Khaldun\", he said in a low, threatening tone. \"I will hold you to your promise. If you fail the homeland, so help me the All-Witnessing, I shall have your life cut short before Manedalusia's next conqueror gets the chance.\"\n\nKhaldun could see the threat was entirely serious. Still, he couldn't help but smile."
  manedalusia.12.a:0 "\"I wouldn't have it any other way.\""
  manedalusia.13.t:0 "A Manedalusian Senate?"
  manedalusia.13.d:0 "The Majlis Ash-Shūrā is a curious institution. Initially created as a simple advisory body for the Sultan's benefit in administration, it would be granted increasingly more autonomy and power over the years in ancient Al-Manedalus, as the Everleaf dynasty grew increasingly disillusioned with their own royal court. When Manedalusia lost its independence and was occupied by Maregypt, the Sultanate was declared null and void as the scions of Everleaf were snuffed out; but the Majlis Ash-Shūrā's fortunes turned when our lands were then conquered by the Kingdom of Abyssinia, and Queen Pawkuno graciously restored the Majlis as a fully self-realized administration for her new provincial territory.\n\nMaterially speaking, this period - the Golden Age of Sailing - was Al-Manedalus' finest hour. Even under the rule of the Abyssinians, our relative autonomy allowed the Majlis and its subsidiary merchant guilds to bring untold wealth and prestige to the city of Coltoba. The University was also at the peak of its influence in this period, attracting intellectuals and scholars from across all Western Zebrica.\n\nOf course, nothing ever lasts, and the Golden Age of Sailing ended abruptly with a whimper. Abyssinia was humiliated by Saddle Arabia's forces, and Manedalusia was annexed as a prize. The Majlis Ash-Shūrā was once again destroyed, and under Arabian rule Al-Manedalus languished economically, strangled out of its lucrative trade routes by the Arabians' stifling administration, until Coltoba was a third-rate metropolis and our countryside a barren backwater.\n\nAs we emerge from our subjugation, at long last fully independent, it is time to rely upon Al-Manedalus' true inheritor and the finest remaining piece of our nation's great legacy. The Majlis Ash-Shūrā shall become Manedalusia's governing body, as a fully realized legislature with elected representatives. The Majlis granted us untold wealth and power when relatively restrained by Abyssinia; now with full independence, unbound by foreign rulers, we will recreate, and perhaps even surpass, our Golden Age."
  manedalusia.13.a:0 "Let's see what they can do."
  manedalusia.14.t:0 "Al-Mukhtārūn"
  manedalusia.14.d:0 "\"Do you understand the weight of what you ask of me, son?\"\n\n\"I do, your Excellency.\"\n\nThe Mufti of Coltoba tapped his hoof on the table and looked off to nothing, as Sayf bowed before him. He was an old stallion, with a grey, disheveled beard and tired eyes. Still, as he leaned on his staff and poured through his manuscripts, he paid little mind to Sayf's armed escort as they surrounded him like hounds. The Mufti read through his notes as fast as he could manage, in search through the Fiqh for a reasonable precedent. Eventually, he said: \"You should know well that it is not within my power to grant anypony the title of Chosen. The title is earned, and when it's earned, it's apparent to all ash-shuhūd.\"\n\nSayf nodded in agreement with his head still lowered in respect to his elder.\n\n\"However,\", he continued. \"what I can do is formalize your claim. You will still have to be the one to seize the opportunity, but at the very least, the faithful will give you a chance to prove yourself.\"\n\nThe general nodded again, without saying a word. The Mufti, on the other hoof, shook his head like a parent might when scoffing at their foal's foolishness.\n\n\"Once that's done, there is no going back.\" Insisted the Mufti. \"You cannot back out. You cannot change your mind. To claim to be Al-Mukhtārūn and be proven wrong is equivalent to apostasy; it's been supported by all precedent I can find. No Qadi has ever allowed a false pretender to back away from the claim. Death would be your most likely sentence; and lifelong exile the most lenient.\"\n\nSayf barely reacted at all. Though an ever loyal faithful, his knowledge of the Fiqh was relatively barebones; still, he had anticipated only the harshest punishment for any failure. He simply said:\"Fortune favors the bold, sir. I am certain of the righteousness of my mission, as Ash-Shahid Himself has instilled it upon me. And I know the price to pay should I fail. I will deliver Al-Manedalus to victory, or pay with my life, and live forever thereafter in infamy.\"\n\nThe Mufti eventually relented with another disappointed shake of his head. \"I cannot stop you. I'll have a word with the Qadi to make a public announcement... and to confirm the precedent for the situation. I hope for your sake you're certain of what you say, son; the All and Ever-witnessing has little mercy for those who invoke His name maliciously.\""
  manedalusia.14.a:0 "Eternal Glory or Eternal Infamy. So be it."
  manedalusia.15.t:0 "Warplan Green"
  manedalusia.15.d:0 "As the military Council gathered once more in the Neighdinat Al-Zahra, under Crimson's oversight, there was both relief and anxious anticipation; said anticipation turned to nervous dread when the stallion announced his intention to reclaim their land from Maregypt by force.\n\n\"What are you thinking, Crimson?\", asked Moonstriker.\"How will we gain a hold in the Green Bay? Grifo's toys were nice to get a hold of, but they won't do us much good against the Maregyptian Navy.\"\n\n\"We won't get a hold in the Bay at all.\", proclaimed Crimson, to everypony's shock. Almost immediately, there was shouting and claims of sudden madness on the dictator's part, but Sayf raised his hoof to silence his council at once.\n\n\"The Maregyptians outnumber us, in the best possible circumstances, one to five.\", he said. \"Their Navy is well developed. Attempting to gain a hoofhold in their playground, even if possible, would cost us more lives than it is worth. We will fight a... defensive war of offense.\" Sayf pointed to Manedalusia's map, making sure to call everypony's attention to its most relevant defensive positions. \"Coltoba must be held at all costs. If it falls, we're as good as dead. But the remaining coast can be sacrificed, lost and regained without stress. We'll erect coastal fortifications, to make their landings as costly as possible, while still allowing them to succeed. We will let them come, play the game on our own terms, on our soil. In the East, the Kom Marebo protects us; they will have to funnel their troops through this narrow, easily held strait. That shall be our plan: defend our eastern border, and defend the city; and then we let them come by sea with no threat from our ships. Let them batter themselves against our coastal forts as they please. Let them flop their soldiers against us like bare flesh against a mighty wall! And when they land, at our leisure, with no option for retreat, let them be bled dry for every single step they take on our land. We will surround them, trap them, and slaughter them to the last!\n\nLet there be no mistake; we will not push into Maregypt until its army has bled an ocean for no gain. Then, and only, then, do we make our move towards Somnambula.\"\n\nIt was a bold plan, one that left the council feeling ill at ease. While Sayf's plan was sound, it relied on perfect positioning and coordination; one misplaced order, one eager commander stepping out of position, a single division out of place, and Coltoba could easily be surrounded and seized.\n\nStill, it was their best option. Pushing into Maregyptian territory, facing their army's full might on their own terms, would surely be the death of them. Sayf's Warplan was a double-edged sword, but it was also their only chance at victory."

  manedalusia.16.d:0 "Verdant Dinar found his colleague smoking a cigarette outside. He had just finished arguing with the village matriarch, and for once she seemed in a good mood when she left the prospecting site, which had been a rare sight to see since they came from Coltoba at the start of the week.\n\n\"Did you tell her?\", Dinar asked.\n\nNazir let out a puff of dark smoke into the cold night air, and rubbed his eyes. \"No. I couldn't spit it out.\"\n\n\"It's... maddening, isn't it?\", Dinar said in a pained chuckle. \"This should be amazing news for everypony, both in Coltoba and here. We all knew there were viable deposits in the Kom Marebo, but this goes beyond even our wildest expectations. It's not the biggest deposit ever recorded, but for how shallow we'd have to dig, it's nothing short of a miracle! And yet...\"\n\n\"They're right on it.\" Nazir grinded his teeth and waved at the sky, as if cursing the All-Witnessing for playing a trick on them.\"Wide open damned desert all around, for MILES, and they are right on it!\"\n\nDanir sighed in shared desperation. He had already sent a telegram to Coltoba; even if he wanted to keep this a secret, he couldn't.\n\n\"So what happens now, you think?\", asked Dinar.\n\nNazir tossed his cigarette into the sand and stomped on it. \"In the best of all possible worlds, there could be cooperation. Get in touch with the right private contractor, distribute compensation to the villagers that would have to move, refurbish the rest of the village... it could work. Maybe.\"\n\n\"You don't sound confident.\"\n\n\"You think?! Do you have any idea how delicate of an operation it'd have to be? For a fraction of the cost, the government could seize the site, send some soldiers in, shoo these ponies away and level their houses flat to the last. They could fully exploit the deposit that way. Why would they do anything else, invest tenfold into accomodating all these villagers to extract a fraction of the oil?!\"\n\n\"Calm yourself! There's no reason to worry. It's none of our bussiness, and besides, I trust everything will work out. Surely there's a suitable compromise.\"\n\n\"You're naive, Verdant.\", scoffed Nazir. \"I don't see things working out well for this little backwater.\""

Remember my friend, Nazir? He works in geological prospecting. I heard from him the new government found a huge oil deposit out in the Kom Marebo, and had to displace a whole village to gain access to it.\"\n\n\"A whole village?\", Samara could hardly believe it, but it sure explained the sudden influx of homeless ponies of all ages.\"But... surely they were given some form of compensation, no?

  manedalusia.18.d:0 "My dearest Mishel,\n\nIt's with great joy that I write to you. After merely a month since departing from Coltoba, I have already turned a profit in the Kom Marebo. Though the local economy is still quite underdeveloped, what I have seen so far has surpassed even my most optimistic expectations. A growing number of young foals and fillies now work in their own bussinesses, and for those that don't, the excess wealth from the oil fields has been invested most wisely, such that less and less rely on subsistence agriculture in this harsh barren soil. Though in these conditions it will take time to fully repay my investment, I now believe I can return to the city with a modest sum for our future together in two years, instead of the five I had initially expected.\n\nWhen I first told you of my plans to travel the country to earn my keep, you were skeptical, and only changed your mind when news of industrial developments backed by the new government reached the public. While I understand you apprehension, I believe your attitude towards wealth and its accumulation betrays a certain naivety on your part. I once told you how the tale of ancient Nagash inspired me to become a businesspony; the city possessed little resources other than sand and a less than amicable river, yet in its prime, its wealth rivaled that of Manephis, whose bountiful river blessed her with a harvest tenfold in its yield. I believe that was because its rulers understood that Destiny may bestow or take resources from us mortals on a whim, but the wise know how to take advantage of those few opportunities, while also making due without them. Though the discovery of oil on Manedalusian soil has been a great boon to our people, it was an equally great boon to be bestowed leadership wise enough to be restrained in their greed. Lesser ponies would've squeeezed their source of wealth until it was dry, and then foolishly squandered its fruits. All the oil wealth in Zebrica would've done us little had it been spent carelessly; but as it was invested most wisely, I and these few ponies out in the desert have seen it bear great fruits indeed.\n\nI hope these thoughts of mine give you pause to reflect while I'm gone, my dear. Be it as it may, I will return within the month to visit, and until then, know that you are never far from my mind.\n\nForever yours,\nHassan"

He had been expecting this meeting, but he was certainly not looking forward to it.\n\n\"Welcome, your Excellency\", he greeted politely. \"You wished to see me?\"\n\n\"I did, yes, Rector\", replied the Mufti. \"You must've received my letters, yes? I'm very concerned about the behavior of your students. I see them often in downtown in their off-time, and without exception they speak about pointless foreign fads, apostate ideologies, atheistic delusions of that sort.\"\n\n\"It is the mark of an educated mind to be capable of entertaining an idea without accepting it, your Excellency\", argued the Rector. \"Give the youngsters some slack. They are young, and the young like to dabble with new ideas. It's how they grow.\"\n\n\"Their adolescent nonsense, I can tolerate, Rector, but not sinful indecencies. I know for a fact your faculty does not enforce proper punishments for promiscuity and other offenses. This must change.\" Before the Rector could respond, he added: \"If you do not heed my request, I'll have no choice but to forward it to my colleague in the courthouse.\"Suppressing a sigh of frustration, Abu darted his eyes about, but eventually replied: \"I'll speak with the Qadi on the matter myself.

  manedalusia.21.d:0 "While reviewing the notes from Lamma Al-A'imma, the Qadi of Coltoba heard a knock on his office door; it was one of his secretaries, which delivered him a letter from a colleague in Sineighi.\n\n\"Your Excellency and Most Esteemed High Judge, Enforcer of the All-Witnessing's Righteous Will,\n\nI write to you with a great deal of urgency and concern. While my congregation rejoices at our reunion with the remaining ash-shuhūd under Coltoba's guidance, there is great unresolved tension in my municipality. Much like in Coltoba, a community of zebras calls Sineighi their home, most of them adherents of the faith. However, the majority of my congregation views them with distrust and suspicion. I have tried to explain to them that At-Taqabbul demands we accept our neighbors as brethren under Ash-Shahid's watchful Eye, but despite my best efforts, my words have so far fallen on deaf ears.\n\nI humbly request your immediate assistance in dealing with the issue. Reports of violence towards innocent zebras have been reaching me as of late, and I worry that the situation will only degrade with time unless swift action is taken to preach to the ponies of Sineighi and condemn this abuse. I await a response from your court, and hope you can spare your time to assist me in this matter.\"\n\nThe Qadi took in these news with both surprise and apprehension. He could certainly spare the time to travel north, and given his position and reputation, he was certain the locals would listen to him. However, he had no power to enforce the Arkān Al-Īmān outside of Coltoba itself, and given the relative autonomy religious communities in the region had since they were separated from Coltoba, enacting sentences for this misbehavior would be politically troublesome, to say the least."

Still, he was allowed to make his way into the heart of their quarters, where two zebras, posing like perfectly sculpted statues, guarded a door. Without saying a word, they moved their carbines out of the way so he could knock.\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nThe corporal found the lone mare practicing caligraphy, striking swift brushes across a blank paper.\n\n\"Grandmistress,\", he greeted. \"I've been tasked with informing you that military high command has decided to take your advice on the doctrinal debate... but despite that, they'd still like you to work with Al-Neighzari.\"\n\nThe mare was pleased, but less than enthusiastic. With a nod and a frown, she replied:\"I am glad that they have seen reason. But still, I resent having to cooperate with that careless bafoon. Be it as it may... Thank you, corporal.\"\n\nMehmet was unsure what it was about her that made her distinct. Even among the Hashm, the whole of them intimidating folk by default, she stood out. He found himself momentarily lost in thought, until he saw the Grandmistress put her pen aside and look in his direction.\n\n\"Is there anything else I can help you with, corporal?\", she asked.\n\n\"N-no, ma'am.\", he replied, before making his leave."

Oh, and there was also a snake. Mehmet only took notice of it when it hissed at him, and he recoiled in instinct at the sight of the thing.\n\n\"Xerxes! No, bad boy!\", a pony came rushing in from the back room, carrying some miscellaneous tools. At his command, the snake relented. \"Apologies, sir, he's not very fond of other ponies. I take it you're with the Army?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Mehmet took a second to adjust his beret and recompose himself. \"Yes, I'm here to inform you high command's willing to look past your civilian background and take your advice on the doctrinal debate. Regardless, we still want you to work closely with the Grandmistress.\"\n\n\"Oh, great!\", he replied with a wide eyed smile. \"I had the pleasure of meeting her at the depot. A most fascinating mare, she is! I can't wait to work with her.\" As soon as he was done talking, the pony tapped his hoof on the floor to summon the snake to his side while he stumbled about, collecting the radio parts. Confused, he looked up and back at Mehmet. \"Well? Off you go now! I have to get things nice and presentable for high command! Be seeing you.\"\n\nMehmet felt the tiny building feeling ill at ease.

  manedalusia.24.d:0 "A revolution had taken place across the land of Al-Manedalus. To outsiders, Manedalusians had always been a quaint but inconsequential people, content to eek out their existence in the shadows of Western Zebrica. While always polite and reliable, more than anything, speaking to a Manedalusian even just a few years ago filled an outsider to their community with a profound sense of melancholy; in all respects it seemed their nation hung by a thread of single-minded stoicism and faith, and Manedalusians spoke with great sorrow of their past glories, resigned to the notion those days were long gone and they'd never return.\n\nBut now, everything had changed. The Coltoba harbor was a place abuzz with activity and life, and creatures of all species, from the shores of Southern Griffonia to the ports of Colthage itself, mingled together in its extensive market stalls. Everypony - from the humble craftsponies in the stalls to the staunch soldiers of its national army - bore smiles on their faces and greeted newcomers with the warm optimism one might display to an old friend. Manedalusia had changed drastically since it won its independence; it had industrialized further, its prime city had expanded considerably, its population had become vastly wealthier and more educated; but more than anything else, the greatest change that had occured was the attitude of its people.\n\nIt is said among the faithful that Ash-Shahid always grants His favor upon those who endure through faith in Him. It seems now that after centuries of strife and subsistence, their god at long last delivers on His promise; and the ash-shuhūd dare to hope again."

He had a barebones workbench filled with tools, but besides that, there was nothing: no other military personnel, no other vehicles, just the engineer by himself in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\"Oh, you're here!\", said Al-Neighzari with excitement when he spotted her in the distance. He quickly finished his work on the engine before closing the truck's hood. \"I was just making sure everything is in order for the test run. You made it just in time to join me.\"\n\n\"This is why you called me all the way out here?\", said the mare with an indignant tone. \"To join you on a joy ride?\"\nAl-Neighzari didn't offer much of an answer besides a nod of agreement and an inviting gesture when he opened the door and got into the driver seat. \"So, what are you waiting for?\" With a heavy roll of her eyes, Samira eventually relented and hopped into the truck, and the mad stallion immediately smashed the gas pedal, making the engine roar aggressively before the vehicle lunged through the sand dunes.\n\nThat day, Samira experienced something she hadn't experienced in many years by that point in her life: fear. Sheer, pure and unrefined fear. Al-Neighzari drove carelessly through the desert reaches of the Kom Marebo, doing doughnuts over the high dunes before pushing the engine to its limits slowly climbing up steep rocky inclines and then letting the truck make its way back down at near terminal velocity. She smacked her head against the ceiling a few times; all the while, the engineer was ecstatic, screaming out his lungs with joy and excitement as streams of black smoke made their way out of the chassis and the suspension nearly broke under the strain. The trip lasted about a half hour, and by the end, Samira collapsed out of the passager seat and onto the cracked soil in utter exhaustion.\n\n\"WOO!\", came another cry of jubilation from the mad mechanic as he rushed out of the driver seat to check open the hood, nearly getting himself burned. \"It's looking good, Samira! This bad boy's got no damage that I can see. When the engine cools off I'll do a thorough inspection, but at first glance, it's passing with flying colors! Exciting, isn't it?\""

You should've seen the original schematics! I initially conceived of a spring-loaded system, much like the one that's used for ejection, but decided to go for a simpler design that waits for a manual push before closing the breech, and...\"\n\nThat went on for a while, but eventually, the engineer stepped aside and allowed a unicorn soldier to test out his prototype. All it took was basic telekinetic force to force the pre arranged shells forward on the loading mechanism just as soon as the spent shell was ejected through the spring-loaded trigger. The breech also closed automatically as soon as the shell was slotted in, and just like that, a new round of fire was initiated. A strict time measurement confirmed that the artillery piece achieved around 20 to 25% increase in rate of fire over their standard artillery, but to the single unicorn charged with loading the shells, the ease of use made it seem twice as fast as a fully crew-loaded piece. It was simple to use, simple to drill other unicorns in the use of, reliable, and by Ash-Shahid, did it deliver on effective rate of fire.\n\nIt wasn't all benefits. The automatically closing breech would make the pieces ever so slightly more expensive to manufacture, and would require more thorough inspection to assure full functionality. Still, for the kind of fast firepower this design could deliver, the increased cost was more than worth it. It was worth it enough, in fact, to overlook the fact that calling the mechanism an Autoloader was a bit of a misnomer."

It is common, indeed expected, among all temples in Manedalusia to paint the All-Seeing Eye in their outer facade, to watch over the faithful. To us, naturally, this brings comfort; Ash-Shahid's divine omniscience is His most quintessential aspect, and we know it is His gaze that creates and sustains the fabric of Creation. However, what to us is an innocent practice, to outsiders is disconcerting and bizarre. They find the All-Seeing Eye's presence across Coltoba to be distressing, and some seem to even believe its meant to represent state surveillance.\n\nThe Qadi's been alerted, and he's been toying with the notion of issuing an edict to ban the All-Seeing Eye in temples near the Coltoba harbor, or at least encourage the congregation to only paint the Eye in the inner walls.

  manedalusia.28.d:0 "Dalia had heeded her orders, even against her barest instinct of survival; as the days went on and her hooves tired and wept for rest, she did not stop, and neither did she stretch her wings to fly ahead. It was a choice she had come to regret, as she collapsed in the nothingness; this time, she could not bring herself to stand back up. Weakily, she dragged her body along the cracked soil for a few yards, but no matter how much she stretched her tired limbs, she could not find the strength to put her weight on them again. She rolled over to stare at the open, cloudless sky, struggling not to open her mouth and take in a deep breath, lest more moisture escape her. Even if she decided to break her instructions and fly, she could not flap her wings now.\n\nFor a moment, she truly believed she had died. She could've sworn to have felt the divine essence leave her, and seen the sunlight become a white ember in the blackness of a dark path.\n\nWhen she regained her senses, she saw her instructor over her; he had a warm smile on his face, one that reminded Dalia of the paternal pride one might feel when seeing their foal take their first few independent steps. He held out a canteen, and like a wild animal, Dalia snapped her neck towards it with what little force remained in her.\n\n\"Easy now\", he said as he tilted her head back, and let water fall slowly over her dry tongue. \"A small sip at a time. You did well. When I first made my way through the Kom Marebo on hoof, I only made it a couple miles further than you. Respected brothers in the Order did worse.\"\n\nHer instructor set up a small tent to give Dalia some much needed shade from the harsh sun, and radio'd for pickup. After a half hour of recovery from shock, Dalia felt almost as good as new, if not somewhat humbled; at the start of the exercise, she believed she could've made her way to extraction. She figured that when the Koltāliba told her platoon they'd die in the desert without their oversight, they were just pushing them to prove themselves. It seems their warning was quite serious.\n\nReluctantly, she climbed into the truck and was driven back to base. The whole time her instructor praised her endurance, but mocked her overconfidence."

They behaved like schoolfillies, meandering about, gossiping in their off time, doing the bare minimum to meet the standards of their profession and avoid punishment. When they inevitably slacked on their duty in a crucial moment, when they misplaced equipment or failed to properly tally its stocked inventory, their carelessness would be paid in blood by others who needed that gear with urgency in the line of duty. In the army, bureaucratic bloat was paid for with lives, and these lazy miscreants seemed not to be aware of it, because the danger they put their peers in was distant and abstracted through layers of administration.\n\nTwelve ponies worked full-time at the depot.

  manedalusia.30.t:0 "On Natural Causality"
  manedalusia.30.d:0 "Despite the controversial nature of many of the fiqh's political implications, one of the most contentious topics in the Lamma Al-A'imma hardly relates to jurisprudence at all, but rather, to natural philosophy. It's a matter that's long been debated within ash-shuhūd congregations, but different authorities, be they the Sultans of Everleaf or the Majlis, never settled on a singular interpretation. The issue of naturalism, and specifically of causality within the natural world, now takes center stage in the ongoing theological debate, and the majority of scholars in the conclave have thrown their support behind one of three major schools of thought.\n\nThe Ash'Ari is the most traditionalist school, tracing their beliefs to the very first Sultan of Manedalusia, Al-Wallid II. The Ash'Ari explicitly and completely reject the existence of necessary causality in nature, fully supporting occasionalism - the notion that Ash-Shahid's observation directly causes all events - and rejecting naturalistic interpretations of the theology. By fully denying the presence of intrinsic power in natural causes, they instead argue that perceived causal chains, as observed by mortals, are merely a mental habit of Ash-Shahid; for instance, fire does not cause things to burn, but rather, Ash-Shahid's perception of fire, as is His whim, in almost all circumstances coincides with burning, but it is ultimately His watchful Eye that acts as the only moving Cause.\n\nThe Mutazilites present themselves as moderates, and trace their theological position to Al-Wallid II's son and inheritor of the Sultanate, Al-Rahman. In their view, natural causality does exist, but it is ultimately subservient to divine will. They argue that Ash-Shahid's Eye created a world with predictable and empirically observable laws, which mortals can study for their own benefit, but ultimately, He preserves the power to override them at his discretion and does so often in the form of miracles and revelations. They also emphasize free will, and are ultimately supportive of empirical science.\n\nLastly, there is the Sineighi school, associated not with a particular figure of historical note, but with the Sineighi region of Manedalusia, where most of its proponents have been from. Perceived as radicals by the traditionalist Ash'Ari, the Sineighi believe in intrinsic causality in Nature; though they technically align with the Mutazilites in their belief that Ash-Shahid's will holds precedent over natural law, they go even further, aguing that Ash-Shahid's primary role is as the First Cause that creates other causes. In their view, the world operates under divine oversight, but they believe Ash-Shahid scarcely ever intervenes through His will directly, as all of Creation operates according to a set of initial laws under His purview and innate essences that operate through the material world. As such, the Sineighi are the ones who most support natural sciences, believing that to understand the material world is to understand the mind of Ash-Shahid by studying His creation; most controversially, they deny the historical validity of most recorded miracles, as they generally reject that Ash-Shahid intervenes in the world directly."

  manedalusia.31.d:0 "Arguably the most daunting topic of discussion in the Lamma Al-A'imma, the exact role of the Equestrian princesses and their immense magical power in the natural order has already caused more than one heated exchange among our scholars. Equestria is without doubt the de facto leading nation among Ponykind, to which our people must inevitably turn now that we emerge as a fully independent state that must establish formal diplomatic relations with others. Given Equestria's long history and its relation to ours here in the shores of Zebrica, competing schools of thought emerged over the centuries on how to treat the Princesses, both as cosmological entities and as sovereign rulers.\n\nThe Aqeedah are the most hardline faction among our scholars, who argue that the Princesses are Rā'ī Al-Arwāh, Spiritseers whose reliance on this force of Harmony is a deliberate falsehood. To them, their alleged control over the celestial bodies is nothing more than an elaborate trick, meant to awe and deceive their subjects for the sake of buttering their political authority.\n\nThe Natural Leader school prefers to treat the princesses as sovereign rulers whose magical powers make them capable of some measure of control over the Sun and Moon, but who are ultimately secular rulers whose power has no spiritual dimension. They controversially accept that Celestia and Luna control the celestial bodies, even if not entirely and without limitation, but do not consider their powers to be divinely ordained in any capacity.\n\nThe Dajjal school is... interesting. Rather than dwell too much on the intricassies of the Princesses' celestial powers, they instead focus on Nightmare Moon, and her barbarian worshippers that make their home in the mountainous northern shores of the Green Bay. With a heavy focus on eschatological theology, the Dajjal worry that Nightmare Moon may be a Djinn, an unholy thing that exists outside Ash-Shahid's watchful Eye, a being of unreality that seeks to invade our world and destroy it from within. They distrust Luna, who they see as a gateway through which the Nightmare perpetually seeks to seep into our reality, and more than anything they wish this creature, and her vessel, permanently destroyed or banished."

  manedalusia.32.d:0 "The Qadi is a position of great authority among any ash-shuhūd congregation, but the extent of his authority and discretion is quite the politically sensitive topic. The degree to which this office is allowed to intervene in legal affairs across Manedalusia has waxed and waned over the centuries, and the situation has only become more contentious now that Manedalusian territories in the north have reunited with our polity. If we are to maintain the integrity of our legal system in these new territories, it's essential that we put into paper just what exactly the Qadi has authority to do and what he doesn't.\n\nDespite the infinity of legal ins and outs regarding the Qadi's position, there are, in truth, only two major interest groups that oppose each other on the extent of his authority; the rural populists and the clerical authorities of Coltoba. Though technically, any major congregation can, and should, elevate a legal scholar to the position, the reality of our nation's troubled existence has made it so the Qadi of Coltoba is the only position of its kind that has maintained any degree of stability over the centuries. To extend the Qadi's legal authority to intervene in cases means to extend the authority of Coltoba over its rural territories and smaller towns, and it is unsuprising that the Qadi himself believes he is justified in extending his jurisdiction to all of Al-Manedalus. Allowing him to do this would make it much easier to centralize and standardize the Fiqh, not to mention it would give the city a great deal of leeway over how the faith is practiced in other communities.\n\nOn the other hoof, the rural populists make a case not against the Qadi's authority, per se, but the extent of its reach. No one outside the city is particularly concerned with how the Qadi intervenes or rules in cases within his jurisdiction, and even the most antagonistic populists don't contest the fact that the Qadi speaks for his congregation. They only argue just how all encompassing said congregation is. At the end of the day, nopony is making a theological claim of particular significance, and all ash-shuhūd agree on the basics of the office and its purpose. Should we favor the populists, we would encourage smaller congregations in Sineighi and Maneistrata to restore their local courthouses and elect their own Qadis; though it would create some tension with Coltoba, it would greatly ease the burden on the judiciary."

  manedalusia.33.t:0 "On the Matter of Kalam"
  manedalusia.33.d:0 "Kalam is a bit of a loaded term among both Mufti and casual ash-shuhūd circles. In the strictest possible terms, Kalam refers simply to the field of religious apologetics; the formal arguments and rational points by which the faithful may convince the infidels of both Ash-Shahid's existence and the worth of His revelations to mortal kind. And while every scholar worth their salt has their own opinions on the matter, this is not the context in which Kalam generates controversy worthy of settlement in the Lamma Al-A'imma. Rather, the congregation is concerned with the other matter usually associated with Kalam: speculative theology; spiritual belief systems that do not directly contradict the Book of Revelation in any way, but expand upon it far beyond anything the original text ever implied. Here in the lands of Western Zebrica, and given Manedalusia's population, these belief systems are often intertwined with traditional zebra alchemy and mythology. For the sake of saving courthouses across our territory a great deal of strain, an official stance on this matter must be established.\n\nThe hardliners make the case that this kind of Kalam is a direct violation of Ash-Shahid's Oneness, as it is typical for these systems of thought to recognize the existence of a myriad spiritual entities that exist independently of Him. The most extreme among their numbers go as far as to suggest that to embrace Kalam is outright heresy, and should be entirely unsanctioned.\n\nAs a middleground, the Mutazilites believe that while Kalam spiritual beliefs are ultimately untrue in the strictest sense, they are valid as informal interpretations of natural phenomena. For instance, the Kalam system of alchemy is argued to not be a natural science in the literal sense, but instead a series of metaphorical interpretations of psychology and numerology.

  manedalusia.33.d_laylah_absent:0 "Kalam is a bit of a loaded term among both Mufti and casual ash-shuhūd circles. In the strictest possible terms, Kalam refers simply to the field of religious apologetics; the formal arguments and rational points by which the faithful may convince the infidels of both Ash-Shahid's existence and the worth of His revelations to mortal kind. And while every scholar worth their salt has their own opinions on the matter, this is not the context in which Kalam generates controversy worthy of settlement in the Lamma Al-A'imma. Rather, the congregation is concerned with the other matter usually associated with Kalam: speculative theology; spiritual belief systems that do not directly contradict the Book of Revelation in any way, but expand upon it far beyond anything the original text ever implied. Here in the lands of Western Zebrica, and given Manedalusia's population, these belief systems are often intertwined with traditional zebra alchemy and mythology. For the sake of saving courthouses across our territory a great deal of strain, an official stance on this matter must be established.\n\nThe hardliners make the case that this kind of Kalam is a direct violation of Ash-Shahid's Oneness, as it is typical for these systems of thought to recognize the existence of a myriad spiritual entities that exist independently of Him. The most extreme among their numbers go as far as to suggest that to embrace Kalam is outright heresy, and should be entirely unsanctioned.\n\nAs a middleground, the Mutazilites believe that while Kalam spiritual beliefs are ultimately untrue in the strictest sense, they are valid as informal interpretations of natural phenomena. For instance, the Kalam system of alchemy is argued to not be a natural science in the literal sense, but instead a series of metaphorical interpretations of psychology and numerology. The belief in astrology is also tolerated as an indirect system of tracking the seasons and as a precursor to proper astronomical science.\n\nAnd lastly, there are the Kalam believers themselves, the Hermetics.

  manedalusia.34.d:0 "Ah, the old debate. Across all ages, it seems to prop up again and again, no matter how much ink is spilled on the topic; whether mortal kind possesses power to determine their own destinies, or whether we are but actors in this divinely ordained play; or, for the more pessimistic, puppets dangling by the strings of Fate. For the less abstractlly inclined, it must seem like a dull, pointless matter of discussion, but the fact it's caused this much contention over the centuries means that for the learned, it matters a great lot. It is unlikely this will be the last time the faithful gather to declare an edict on the matter, but once more, we must discuss the nature of free will, as it relates to our position under the All-Witnessing's Eye.\n\nOn this matter, the Mutazilites are the most... libertarian, for lack of a better term. They fully support the existence of free will as a part of Ash-Shahid's divine Justice; if mortal kind did not possess true capacity for independent choice, then it could not be said to possess the power of true judgement, and thus our moral choices would be worthless.\n\nThe Ash'Ari, in a rather unusual circumstance, are the moderates on the matter. Theirs is the most dense argumentation, as they consider the matter of free will one of the most important long standing issues of our theology. They believe in what they call \"Liberal Predestination\"; the notion that Ash-Shahid directly creates all actions, much in the way that they believe He creates all events. However, they believe that in the case of us mortal folk in possession of the divine essence, a soul, we \"inherit\" this action from the All-Witnessing, such that it becomes our own. In short, we acquire actions from Ash-Shahid, rather than creating them spontaenously, but free will still ultimately exists as an enforcement of the divine mandate through mortal hooves.\n\nLastly, the fatalists. A lot of their number can be argued to be Ash'Ari with a particularly pessimistic bent, but in short, they argue against their fellows' synthesis of free will with Ash-Shahid's total omnipotence. Being that His will is utterly absolute, and Creation exists at His discretion, the fatalists argue for full predestination, though they still support the normal application of punishment as a deterrent."

In ancient times, Manedalusians were a competing mercantile power in the region, which Colthage clashed with on multiple occasions economically, though never militarily. And after all these centuries, they now come to us with a proposal for trade cooperation. Hippogriffia's dominance of the western coastal waters make the Green Bay and its trade largely inaccessible to us, but the Manedalusians have free access to the Bay and have already begun entrenching themselves as an integral part of its trade network.

It was dark, and he could only catch a glimpse of light that snuck through the thick, tightly packed bars of his cage. Everytime the truck hit a bump, he smacked his head against the metal. It went on and on for what felt like an eternity, but in truth, the drive must've lasted only an hour or so. When the truck finally came to a halt, the sound of marching hooves surrounded him, his cage opened, a bag was immediately thrown over his head and his chain yanked forward. Helplessly, he stumbled forwards step by step, and to his horror the route became quite familiar to him, from the twists and turns of the Manephis streets to the hard steps of the central palace. Home; he was being brought home. But why did it sound so different?\n\nWhen the bag was removed, he found himself standing flanked by two stone faced ponies in austere uniforms, in the throne hall. By the throne - not sitting upon it, but observing it like a curious tourist - was a tall crimson stallion with a deadly ember in his eye. He slid his hoof down the length of the throne's arm, and looked back towards Shepser with a stunning gaze that pierced through him. \"Your custodian, sadly, has evaded my grasp. My soldiers couldn't find Khefer.\", he tilted his head to the side as he strutted towards Shepser with a twisted smile. \"Perhaps he and his knights fled across the Green Bay, and left you to pick up his bill.\"\n\nShepser attempted to speak in turn, to ask what he meant, but he had spent so many days in hiding, not saying a word, that his dry throat gave out on him before he got a word out. The stallion stopped right in front of him, and raised a hoof as if he was saluting him. \"Truly, it is an honor to find myself in the presence of a living god! But alas, your majesty, I'm afraid I've come to collect a debt a millenium in the making, and you are the only one left in Maregypt who can pay it.\" With a nod to his guards, Shepser was dragged kicking away from the throne hall, up the echoing stairwells towards the central balcony, from where the olds Pharaohs could gaze upon their city from high above.\n\nWhen Shepser was finally allowed to see what had become of his city, he wished to have never found out. A blazing orange glow emerged from the distant districts, while in the central square right in front of the palace, hundreds, perhaps thousands of Maregyptian soldiers had their bodies stacked into a pile. The sky was darkened by a cloud of black, noxious smoke, and to Shepses, it felt like he bore witness to the end of the world.\n\n\"I am not the kind of pony to hold grudges, your majesty\", said the stallion with a suppressed laughter. \"Consider your debt repaid in full.\" As soon as he was done speaking, the stallion nodded towards his soldiers with a grin.

For too long have the faithful sheepishly hidden away from the world, content to bend the knee to foreign infidels. For too long have they built their heathen empires in Zebrica, whilst our congregation gathers in reclusive halls and village temples. No more! The All and Ever-Witnessing guides our hooves.

His eye caught a strange anomaly; even after their capture of Manephis, a large amount of troops and extra material was being redirected towards the city. Initially, he simply thought there were plans to make the city a center of temporary administration while the army still patrolled the Neighle, but he was confused as to why he wasn't informed of this. It was only when he raised the question to military staff, and was promptly dismissed, that Khaldun realize something was amiss.\n\nTaking some trustworthy bodyguards and his personal vehicle, Khaldun travelled from Somnambula to Manephis to personally see what was going on, and what he found froze him to the core. Despite his previous commands to assure the Maregyptian civilians of their safety, martial law was still being enforced in the city. Strict curfew was being enforced, Sayf's forces were rationing and withholding access to public spaces to them, and most concerningly of all, it seemed as if all of the Maregyptian forces' casualties were being routed to Manephis, instead of handed to local authorities for proper burial and rites.\n\nWhen Khaldun caught word of the stockpiles of petroleum that were being stored in the outer districts by Sayf's forces, the realization of his colleague's intentions dawned upon him; a moment of doubt consumed him, before he raced back to his vehicle to storm off and find Crimson, before it was too late."

Said hopes were dashed when Khaldun, out of options for protest, stormed into his cabin. As he entered, he was immediately surrounded by Sayf's guards, who were both on edge and confused at Khaldun's behavior.\n\n\"I saw the Manephis stockpiles, Crimson\", said Armil, his voice cracking from rage and disbelief. \"Were you intending to keep this secret from me until after the fact? Were you and the others planning to demote me? Have you lost your mind?!\"\n\nThe accusation enraged Sayf, who put down his teacup and replied through gritted teeth: \"I tire of your insolence and pretentious sympathy for our enemies, Armil.\" Khaldun prepared to reply, but before he could, Sayf continued: \"Have you ever had to beg for stale bread, debase yourself for your survival as I did? No; you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth. You were given your place in life served on a platter, and while our people languished under foreign occupation, you were gallivanting around the coast of Zebrica in your ship! You were sold romantic fantasies of the military life, and now that I do what I must to assure the future of our homeland, you dare to defy me? And for what?!\"\n\nKhaldun was at a loss for words. Even despite everything - the disagreements, the fights, their conflicting visions for what Manedalusia could become - he considered Crimson as a true friend. The slight made Khaldun question whether all that had been a lie. \"Sayf, please\", he pleaded. \"I'm begging you. Don't do this.\"\n\nKhaldun was wrong in his assumption. Even despite everything that had happened in the last few months, Crimson did, at some point, consider him a friend. But though his advice and companionship were valuable, Sayf could not ignore Ash-Shahid's revelations. He had already jumped past the point of no return, and divine will could not be swayed by pleading. His heart hardened, Sayf replied: \"You're compromised, Armil. I'm afraid that as it stands, I'll have to politely ask that you retire with grace from the service. As a token of respect for our friendship, I will allow you to walk away..."

  manedalusia.42.d:0 "Sayf is, and has always been, a stallion of faith. But despite his devotion to Ash-Shahid, he knew that he was no scholar. If he was to command the respect of his subjects, he needed to have an intelligent and well-read advisor at his side, who could instruct him on the finer details of the Fiqh and help him settle religious matters. Though there was no shortage of learned ponies in Al-Manedalus that could theoretically fulfill that role, only two stuck out to him as ones Sayf could trust.\n\nFirst, there was the Qadi of Coltoba. While the Mufti was technically the most fitting pony for an advisory position, Sayf disliked his lack of resolve, and didn't feel like he could be trusted. The Qadi, on the other hoof, not only had decades of faithful service in the judiciary under his belt, he was also a strict, austere pony that possessed that indomitable spirit of religious authority that would make his word carry, even amongst the most stubborn of subjects and naysayers. In addition, he was a well respected member of the community.\n\nSecondly, there was Moonstriker. Save for Khaldun, Laylah was the most well-read and educated member of the old military council, a mare of immense passion for the written word. Her status as a military officer would also inspire confidence among the armed forces, as Manedalusia's common soldiers could be assured important matters were not being handled by civilian servants with no knowledge of their affairs. The one point of great contention, however, was Moonstriker's outspoken stance as a Hermetic, a less than popular theological proposition. Given her verbal spats with the Mufti, it was likely civilians would not heed her word as seamlessly as they would the Qadi's."

Arriving in Trotgiers, his procession was met with honors and celebration, but the high flying banners of the Sultanate, under which Karkadannistan's diminished standards meekly wavered in the breeve, gave the adorned streets the distinguished look of a military triumph. His kingdom was a conquered domain, and he knew it.\n\nTahmasp met, at long last, the Crimson Sultan. He had heard tales of this pony, but the far flung rumors did a disservice to the stallion, who despite being eclipsed in size still towered over Tahmasp. The Sultan's face was slashed by a wicked smile, as he said: \"Greetings, mighty Shahanshah. I've been told that during our conflict, you received from divine providence a vision of things to come. Is it true, your Highness? Are you prepared to fully embrace your role under His All-Seeing Eye?\"\n\nThe question was largely a formality, but it was earnest.

Before she stepped in, however, a strange mixture of curiosity and need for closure stopped her in her tracks.

When Samira stepped inside the train and the doors closed behind her, it left the corporal feeling a particularly indescribable melancholy. The Grandmistress was, in all respects, a most fascinating mare, and even though he always knew the two of them could never be together in that way, she still caught his eye in a way no other ever did.\n\nFrom inside the train cart, already at her seat, Samira gave Mehmet a last visage of her smile, something that few, even among her closest compatriots with the Hashm Koltāliba, had ever seen."

For the first time since his ascension to the throne, the All-Witnessing had granted him a clear revelation of things to come. Dark clouds gathered over Zebrica, and a great evil hid past the reaches of the Zebhara.

And as soon as that as done, he stormed out, to continue his searches through the desert domain; in search of what, he couldn't say for sure.\n\nWhen Sayf came across the archeological site, he immediately recognized it for what it was. A local they'd brought along as a guide seemed confused and shocked, but the Sultan did not heed his pleas, and commanded the site's immediate destruction.

He was not satisfied until the archeological site had been flattened, and every inch of the mysterious structures demolished and buried deep into the Zebhara sands. And then, one of his scouting parties returned to him, having found something of interest buried in those sands.\n\n...\n\nDays later, sitting comfortably in the contemplative silence of the Neighdinat Al-Zahra, Sayd meditated in peace and opened his mind to the All-Seeing Eye.

He waited and waited for the right moment.\n\nAnd when it came, he did not hesitate.\n\nThe desert pass' Maregyptian forces were drained, as more of their soldiers were taken away to participate in renewed offensives by sea.

They were severely mistaken, and the soldiers would pay heavily for that mistake.

  manedalusia.53.t:0 "The King's March"
  manedalusia.53.d:0 "Abyssinia's use of pony slaves was not merely a crime against decency. Manedalusians once purchased and sold slaves themselves, and it'd be hypocritical to cast too harsh a judgement. No; what made the Abyssinian practice so wicked was the sheer degradation of it. To have these large felines slacking on top of ponies until their backs broke, to have them care over pointless cash crops solely to feed the Abyssinian nobility's greed. That was unforgivable. And for a crime against decency and honor, an equal humiliation was due. Slavery would be abolished among the catfolk, naturally, and severe public beatings were in order for any slaveowner who did not comply at once. But to truly balance the scales, the Sultan had a bright idea. A King represents his subjects and the nation, its prides and its sins; and to the King of Abyssinia fall the weight of all of their sins...\n\nThe parade was arranged as a standard military affair. Patrols were on duty, and the Sultanate's soldiers were quick to rally native catfolk militias to keep order among the mixed crowd. The Sultan requested his chariot to be outfitted for five passangers, himself and four others; and he commanded from the defeated Abyssinians to bring to him four of their most untouchable miscreants. Three ponies, one barely old enough to stand, and a zebra were brought before him. The Sultan welcomed them, and invited them to sit by his side, as the whipped and sobbing king was forced to put on the reins.\n\nIt was in equal parts a jubilant and sad display. The King stopped often during his voyage through his city's main streets, and Sayf made sure to have him whipped often every time he did so. The populace watched with a mix of awe, horror and dread.\n\n\"...s-sir?\", Sayf was taken aback when the small filly sitting by his side spoke up. Her older custodian, likely her father, tried to shush her, fearing some manner of retribution, but the Sultan smiled warmly and looked down at her.\n\n\"There is no need to be scared, little one\", he said. \"You're not scared, are you?\"\n\nThe young filly shook her head. She did not look scared; more curious than anything. And so, Sayf bent down to whisper to her: \"You are of Manedalusia now, child. And one thing you should know about Manedalusians is that we always repay our debts, no matter what. And I can assure you, little one; no friend has ever served me, and no enemy has ever wronged me...\"\n\nSayf was interrupted by the King's plea for mercy, and before he could respond, the Sultan sprang forth, whip in hoof, to silence him with a crack and a new slash across his exposed back. The child, still watching with morbid curiosity, did not break eye contact with the Sultan, whose smile quickly returned."

  manedalusia.54.t:0 "The Duel"
  manedalusia.54.d:0 "\"What are you waiting for, Prince??\"\n\nAs the crowd gathered around the Sultan and his opponent, the air in Mareakech seemed so thick it could be cut with a blade. Faisal stood motionless, staring down at his sword. He had a strange expression, one his palace servants, forced to watch, could not recognize. Sayf, on the other hoof, seemed utterly livid.\n\n\"When Manedalusia still suffered under occupation,\" he said, \"word still reached us of your decadent indolence. It's why your contry fell apart, was it not? You have the audacity to pretend to be a prim and proper prince now, Faisal? Now that you stare down death at the hooves of a creature half your own size?\"\n\nFaisal's shaking limbs came to a standstill, and he took a deep breath. Still trembling, he reached down to grab the sword. When he looked back up at his foe, he had a look about him like he was staring down Death itself.\n\nThe duel itself was a short affair. Faisal swung his blade loose, barely holding onto it. Sayf had always been used to aiming down the sights of rifles, and he wasn't much of a swordspony himself, but against such a pitiful opponent, even his meager skill was more than sufficient to end the spectacle shortly.\n\nFaisal, for his credit, did not beg for mercy when he took the first blow and fell to the ground. He stood silent when Sayf plunged the tip of his sword into his heart, only letting out a barely audible gasp of pain. Unlike how he had lived, he died with honor, or at least a vague semblance of it.\n\nSayf smiled, and held up the sword for the crowd to see. His soldiers rejoiced, and the Arabians... well, some rejoiced too. Others cried. Most were silent. The ghost of Arabia's sins had come to collect its debts, and even though the Grand Prince was far from universally liked, his death was something of a symbolic death for the whole of Arabia as an independent polity. The Crimson Sultan stood triumphant once again."

  manedalusia.55.d:0 "Khaldun had always defered to Sayf's advice when it came to military matters, and even with him gone, the noblestallion reflected on what he'd do in this situation. Crimson had a one-track mind, but when it came to the battlefield, he possessed an otherworldly degree of calm and patience. So, Khaldun waited; with Maregyptian casualties piling up and Manedalusian forces entrenched in their position, Khaldun knew well the position he was in. The enemy swung wildly at their raised shield, each strike parried with little effort. They were draining their energy, and all Khaldun had to do was to hold strong, and wait for the right moment.\n\nAnd when the moment came to strike, he did not hesitate.\n\nWhile the Manedalusian Army suffered little in the way of casualties, Maregypt is now so utterly depleted of forces their current regiments are both understaffed and undersupplied, and surely in a perfectly vulnerable position to Manedalusian assault. After months of grueling siege, Khaldun smiled. Coltoba's defence was an achievement that Crimson himself would applaud; and now, the time has come to see this war brought to a swift conclusion."

  manedalusia.57.d:0 "Moonstriker levitated a pair of sparring scimitars and swung without constraint against the Grandmistress. The mare was swift on her hooves, and despite Laylah's efforts, she failed to land a single blow past Samira's blade. It was only a matter of time until she slipped, and angled the sword such that the Grandmistress could break her spell and disarm her. Mehmet watched on with perplexity.\n\"Care to give it a try, Major?\", asked Laylah with a grin. Mehmet, taken aback, replied in short: \"I'm by no means a swordspony. I'm an artillery officer! Backline duty.\"\nSamira grabbed Mehmet's attention by raising the tip of her blade towards him, which made him ever so slightly recoil. \"Do you take us Koltāliba as antiquated, Mehmet? Because I remind you, my subordinates and I have been using carbines since the time you in the garrison were stuck firing muskets.\"\n\"N-not what I was implying at all!\", Mehmet nervously laughed, leading Samira to lower the weapon. \"Still, I take it you value sparring to keep your senses sharp, yes?\"\n\n\"Indeed, and I think you'll find it hard to contest that it's a crucial skill for any military officer, backline or not.\", taking a moment to think as she grabbed one of Moonstriker's sword off the ground, Samira eventually said: \"The number of cannons you have at your disposal will be finite. In battle, it'll often occur that separate fronts, divisions or recon groups need your firepower with haste, and you must choose who to provide it to and who to leave to their own devices until later. The backlines deceive you, Mehmet; this is not a decision you can take your time to calculate without a care. In our line of bussiness, backline or frontline, hesitation is paid for with lives. So?\" Samira held out the spare sword, and Mehmet hesitantly grabbed hold of it, tipping it from side to side to get a feel for the weight of the heavy blade.\n\nSamira went easy on him. She knew he was not trained in swordfighting, and their short spar felt to him like a crash course. "Keep the blade closer to your center\", she said, prompting Mehmet to reposition.\"Swift strikes, one after the other. When not swinging, protect yourself.\" When the Grandmistress felt that she had taught Mehmet some of the basics, she swiftly tricked him with a feint and sent the scimitar flying off his hoof and towards Laylah, that caught it with her levitation before it hit the ground. Samira congratulated Mehmet, even if half-heartedly, and excused herself back to the Order's temple.\n\n\"Don't worry, rookie\", Laylah laughed. \"She's always like this. You get used to it.\" Moonstriker meant it in earnest, but catching wind that Mehmet seemed to be feeling down on his luck, staring at the sword, she continued: \"Trust me, Mehmet, if Samira thought you weren't high command material, then you wouldn't be here at all. If she's willing to give you your lumps, it means she has high expectations for you! Best not to disappoint her.\"\n\nThe Major picked himself up, smiled, and swung the sword about once again. He and Laylah continued to spar for a few hours, and eventually, after many repeated failures to beat his peer to the first blow, he managed to win a round by taking advantage of Laylah's overreach. Just as he saw Samira do, he feinted, swung back, and hit.\n\n\"Hey, no fair!\", cried Moonstriker. \"I see Samira's rubbing off on you already. She's got a knack for playing dirty like that.\""

  manedalusia.58.d:0 "\"I gave you an order, soldier!\", barked Crimson at the terrified pony at the helm. \"Turn this ship around this instant!\"\n\nAs the small vessel kept making distance from the Coltoba harbor, everyone aboard could still catch a glimpse of the fires raging through the city. Shots still rang through the Green Bay's air. Every pony in Coltoba knew the governor was a cruel cat, but none would have predicted he'd resort to something like this; even without asistance from the Abyssinian Army, he had cornered the Council's members in the heart of town. Sayf only escaped that fate by sheer luck, having routed suppression forces in the urban outskirts, but now, his own soldiers had to restrain him before he unholstered his pistol to command them to return at gunpoint.\n\nThe scuffle aboard was stopped when an unusually calm voice came through the onboard radio. Sayf rushed to answer: \"Khaldun? Tell me what's going on.\"\n\n\"I think it's over, Sayf\", the noble stallion's cracked voice spoke, bearing something of a fatalistic laughter. Sayf could hear Laylah and Clover Breeze screaming in the background. \"I'm hit, and I don't think I've got much lifeforce left in me. We lost Al-Manesūr, and the Koltāliba aren't coming through. We think Samira's gone too.\"\n\n\"I'm on my way\", without a second thought, Sayf replied. \"Just hold on for an hour, maybe two at most, I'll be there with my forces. We took almost no casualties on the way, I just need to-\"\n\n\"We're done, Sayf\", Khaldun cut him off. \"It was a valliant effort, but we played our cards poorly. There is no salvaging this.\" He stopped, and Laylah yelled something Sayf couldn't quite get. \"They're at the door now. You need to go.\"\n\n\"Armil, Ash-Shahid damn you, listen to me! Get me Moonstriker right now, she needs to-\"\n\n\"Goodbye, Sayf. I have faith in you still. I just want you to know that I-\"\n\nSayf heard a knock, a bang, and then shots. Armil's voice gave way to a dull, constant static. \"Khaldun? Khaldun!\"\n\nNothing. Letting go of the radio speaker, Sayf eyed his soldiers with a piercing stare, his heart racing. As he looked back towards Coltoba, for the first time in years, he held back a tear."

  manedalusia.59.d:0 "The situation in Coltoba had been deteriorating for months, and despite Abyssinia's best efforts, the locals had been riled to a frenzy. Things were already bad enough before, but ever since Basha Bingus crushed the Manedalusian nationalists and their attempted coup, the populace had only gotten more violent and extreme. The Abyssinian government had already been caught by surprise once, and they'd be so again: one of the members of the military Council responsible for the coup had survived.\n\nAnd he had returned.\n\nAbyssinian forces only caught wind of what was happening when radio communications started trickling in from the overwhelmed garrison forces. The Qadi and Mufti of Coltoba, traditional leading figures of their community, had died during the fighting that took place in Coltoba, and with them gone, the Manedalusians were rallying around the last shred of leadership they had. The stallion Crimson Sayf was already known to Abyssinia, and to learn he was still alive was a shock to all military personnel. It seems he had bided his time, and returned at his first opportunity to retake the reins.\n\nTo the surprise of every military officer in Panthera, Sayf announced himself openly through the radio."

  manedalusia.60.d:0 "\"To the wretched spawn of Abyssinia,\nfor many years I've dreamed of the day I would see my home free from your claws. I hoped and prayed that Coltoba would one day be the shining, cultured and wealthy city that my more educated colleagues spoke of it being in long bygone ages; that its people would flourish on their own terms. I dedicated myself, body and soul, to see this dream come true, and I would've died a happy stallion had it been the last thing I bore witness to.\n\nIt took you over a thousand years, but you've finally succeeded in killing my dream. Coltoba is a burning wreck, and with sorrow your blackened hearts cannot grasp, I see now that there is no hope left for my people. Their freedoms, their hopes, their prospects, and even their lives: you took it all away... But by the grace of Ash-Shahid, on whom All depends, no matter how hard you tried, you could not take away their honor; and Manedalusian honor demands that all debts be settled, one way or another.\"\n\nBarely stopping himself from crushing the microphone in his hooves, Sayf took a long pause to steady himself. Turning his head from the radio, he looked out the balcony window from the governor's palace to his soldiers marching below, and to the body of Bingus hanging from a street lamp.\n\n\"Everything you've done to Al-Manedalus, I shall return to you tenfold. I expect no mercy from you, and neither should you expect it from me. This is our final stand...\""

  manedalusia.61.d:0 "\"You desire death.\", Sayf contemplated as he observed the caged King. \"I can see it in your eyes.\"\n\nThe cat remained unresponsive. His eyes were empty. Save for a mild and unceasing shaking that consumed him for a few hours until it finally faded away, he had hardly even moved since he was captured.\n\n\"What was it that I took from you?\", Sayf asked. The question caught Gomez's attention. \"I ask genuinely. Was it your city? Your slaves? Your servants? Your people? Of the things that I took from you, which have the most sway over your heart?\"\n\nThough Sayf did not mean it, the King took it as an insult. Crimson had succeeded in reviving the last shred of vitality in the drained King, and with his last gasping effort, the cat lunged from his cage against the steel bars, slashing and swiping with his claws at the stallion just out of reach. Sayf hardly flinched, and observed him until he tired himself out, stopped hissing and thrashing and layed back catatonic on the cage floor.\n\n\"Was it someone you loved?\", and with that, Sayf managed to prod an answer. Gomez did not speak, nor did he even move, but ever so silently, as the cat slumped against the bars and held his face out of sight, Sayf could hear him sob. The stallion recalled that the Queen had been killed during the palace siege. \"A friend of mine you had killed used to say that the souls of true lovers are united into a single substance; that there is nothing more painful than separation after union. I recall him saying once:'Love begins with a glance, blossoms with a smile, blooms with a kiss, and ends with a tear.'\"\n\nSayf stood watch over the King for some time afterwards, until he ceased to cry. Unholstering his service pistol, he pondered on what Khaldun would've said. \"Out of respect for him, I think it fitting that you do not see the end of this road. Make no mistake: you've doomed my people to death, and in return, I will do the same to yours. But that hardly seems to matter to you now.\""

  manedalusia.62.d:0 "Sayf had started the ride optimistic. As the remaining feline military officers were dragged inside the military truck, bound and gagged, he was content. Not anymore. He was unsure what had changed.\n\nAs the truck made its slow voyage through the despoiled countryside, the soldiers in the back, at Sayf's orders, made sure the felines could see it all. Some of them pleaded and begged. Some of them even cried. The majority said nothing at all. Sayf paid them no mind. Lost in his thoughts, he pondered what Al-Manesūr would've commented when seeing this display. He was an austere stallion, arguably even more than Sayf, but he had always had a snide streak. And Moonstriker! Where even to start with Moonstriker...\n\nSayf cut the voyage short. He had originally planned on a cross country trip, from Panthera back to Coltoba. He had even planned to have the officers executed back at their catital, or what little remained of it. He didn't bother; after everything that had happened, he was tired of it all. He ordered their immediate execution, there in the countryside outside Dire Pawa, and left the bodies to rot. Then he had his soldiers piled onto another truck in the convoy, so he could drive back by himself.\n\nOn the way back, he beat himself over his foolishness. What was the point of this sad display anymore? The cats were all dead. His job was done. There was no one left to intimidate or humiliate. Nothing but rubble."

But you weren't here, were you?\"\n\n\"Words cannot describe my disappointment in you\", said Armil. \"You always had a one-track mind, Sayf, but this... how could you do this?\"\n\n\"I did what had to be done.\", Sayf slowly repeated himself, on the cusp of rage.\n\n\"Did you?! Was it divine providence that compelled you? Is that what you tell yourself?!\" Sayf had never seen Khaldun so angry and unrestrained. \"Once upon a time, Manedalusia was a land of traders and artisans. Our people were explorers, sailors, artists, scholars! And you... You've made us a land of butchers and lunatics. Is this the legacy you'd have us leave behind?\" Shaking his head, Khaldun finally whispered, defeated: \"Why did I ever have faith in you?\"\n\nThe thought sent Sayf over the edge. In a swift motion, he tipped over the table and sent his gear flying across the room. \"They took everything from us! All we've worked for, all that we've sacrificed! Would you have had me do nothing?! Well, too bad, because you weren't here to stop me! You weren't here to-!\"\n\n\"Sir!\", Sayf's subordinate's voice snapped the stallion back to reality as he came rushing through the bunker's door. \"I heard commotion, were you... Sir, who are you talking to?\"\n\nSayf calmed himself, and without saying a word, he lifted the table and put everything back together. When he was done, he simply slumped back in his chair and continued writing, like nothing had happened."

  manedalusia.64.d:0 "The ponies of Manedalusia follow a strict and very particular interpretation of old Arabian religious tradition, one that dates back well before Arabia's unification under the Saddle Dynasty and whose practice is largely extinct on the peninsula today, having been carried over to Coltoba by its founding Sultan, Everleaf Al-Wallid II.\n\nThe chief figure of their religion is Ash-Shahid, the All and Ever-Witnessing, Manedalusia's sole and monolithic deity whose power over Creation and the spiritual realm is absolute; thus the followers of Ash-Shahid call themselves the ash-shuhūd - the Witnesses.\n\nIn ash-shuhūd belief, Ash-Shahid, the first entity to be aware of Its own existence, created the Universe and all its contituent elements at the beggining of Time, when He opened His All-Seeing Eye to the primordial nothingness of Outer Night until it formed into an orderly realm under His vigilant supervision. The ash-shuhūd place a great deal of importance on sight and all other forms of perception, as they believe one's ability to perceive and conceive of the world is Ash-Shahid's primary divine aspect.\n\nThe body of ash-shuhūd religious law is called the Fiqh, which is deeply entwined with the secular law of Manedalusia. The Fiqh's main source is the Book of Revelation, the primary ash-shuhūd religious text, though it also contains a litany of judicial and ethical treatises drafted by religious authorities over the centuries. It is common for more rural communities to have no local leaders outside of their religious authorities.\n\nThe primary positions of authority among the ash-shuhūd are the Mufti, a scholar endowed with the right to pass non-binding opinions that expand the Fiqh, and the Qadi, an elected judicial authority that can pass sentences based on the precedent established through the Fiqh.\n\nAsh-shuhūd religious traditions include the practice of morning fasting, private prayer and individual study of the Book."

Khaldun pondered their failure in silence; they had played their cards as flawlessly as could have been expected from them, and still, the Abyssinian Army had made its way to secure the border reaches of Coltoba before they had time to strike. It was frustrating. Every Council member knew their chances were flimsy, even in the best possible circumstances, but still, to have done everything right and still have failed weighed heavily on their hope.\n\nThe atmosphere was somber, and no pony said a word for the many hours of trekking. It wasn't until they had made their way to the edge of the desert, when the sand dunes curved such that Coltoba's lingering light dissipated in the horizon behind them, that Sayf, of all ponies, stopped in his tracks. The stallion was usually the most steel-willed and single-minded among their number, and to see him longing in such a way almost made Armil chuckle.\n\n\"Worry not, friend.\" he said to his colleague. \"Despair is only for those who don't have faith. You have faith, don't you?\"\n\nSayf seemed less than enthusiastic. \"You were always annoyingly optimistic about our prospects, Khaldun. So what now? Our odds were already poor when we started. Now, the way I see it, they're impossible.\"\n\nKhaldun, momentarily caught in the dread and pessimism, stood silent, but not for long. \"Many a so called impossible thing has come to pass before, Sayf. What we're doing, we're doing it because we love Al-Manedalus; and when love is true, it cannot die. It merely hides, like a fire beneath the ashes.\"\n\nKhaldun was well aware Sayf was no stallion for literary excerpts. Still, something about Khaldun's words grabbed him.

They knew well that Sayf would never willingly budge on the issue of governance, but still, they stood in utter disbelief as Khaldun picked up the letter and read his words of departure. - a final screed against their folly for throwing it all away and allowing the Sultanate to be dissolved. To their knowledge, there was nothing in Sayf's life that he did not carry to its bitter end, no matter what, and to have him abandon the homeland, after all they'd been through together, stung deeply.\n\n\"Desertion!\", spoke Al-Manesūr, furious. \"I'll report this to the Assembly at once.\"\n\nAs the stallion raced out of the palace, Moonstriker said softly: \"I can't believe it.

Don't tempt me with more.\" As Zarishat ever so catiously began tipping her bottle to pour a drink into his empty glass, Crimson held out a hoof to stop her own. \"That was a threat. Go away.\"\n\nGrumbling some profanity, the drunkard finally wandered off, giving Crimson a moment of much needed respite. He listened to the soft wind blowing from the ocean, and for a brief moment, he felt at peace. All the world's pieces felt in place, and under the warmth of the sunset's pleasant shine, Crimson let out a deep sigh of regret. It seems that he'd have to swallow his pride and admit it: Khaldun was right.\n\nThe image of the smug smile on his face instilled Crimson with more dread than the prison time."

  manedalusia.71.d:0 "Catrina was forced to kneel before the Sultan in the throne hall of the Neighdinat Al-Zahra. She had been stripped of her regal robes and her jewelry, and forced to wear the stained, used clothes of a peasant Abyssinian cat. Crimson had secured the loyalty of many of Catrina's former allies, even if under the threat of extreme violence, but he saw fit to arrange for the Despot herself to suffer the weight of all of Abyssinia's sins.\n\n\"Had I conquered the Kingdom under the rule of Gomez Mawkonnen\", he said to the chained feline. \"his sentence would've been death. For the crimes against my nation's honor that the catfolk have committed, I believe that to be the only rightful sentence. But alas, it seems you've robbed me and my fellow Manedalusians of our chance for this justice, Catrina of House Catwe... and for a noblelady of your ilk, I believe a swift execution to be far too lenient a punishment.\"\n\nCatrina's eyes narrowed and she braced herself. In the ride over to Coltoba, her mind raced with curses at the four-legged beasts for usurping her throne, and everything she had sacrificed so much to achieve. She believed a long torture would be her fate, and the Crimson Sultan's words seemed to confirm it.\n\n\"I can see the kind of creature that you are\", he continued with a sly smile. \"When I was a young foal, I had to beg for food and coin for my survival. It instilled in me a deep humility that I carry to this day; even now, as I command the faithful and the armies of Al-Manedalus follow my every command, I know that all creatures, even I, bow to the will of the All-Witnessing, as it is to Him alone that belong all material things. This is a lesson that would do you well to learn to its fullest, Catrina.\"\n\nCatrina's heart skipped a beat at the thought. Without warning, her chains were unlinked, and her escort, a pair of Manedalusian soldiers, stepped back, allowing her to slowly get back on her paws, shaking.\n\n\"You are free to go\", said the Sultan with a deep, echoing command. \"No harm shall fall upon you in my dominion. Though you are stripped of your noble title, and House Catwe wiped from the record henceforth, any violent action against your person is forbidden. Such is my command.\" Catrina anticipated the zealot's words, and clutching her fist in rage, she gulped and stared daggers at the stallion. \"But all your property is now the Sultanate's. All of it. Every last coin in your family vault, every item in your manor, every piece of land to your name, even all the dresses in your wardrobe. All of them belong to the State now.\" With a commanding gesture, the Sultan ordered the Neighdinat's gates opened once again, and her escorts grabbed hold of the shellshocked feline. \"The Mufti's associates run a soup kitched near the harbor. You should get a good, warm meal, before you decide whether to make your residence here in Coltoba. Farewell, Catrina\"\n\nAs the Sultan's guard dragged the former Queen of Abyssinia away, Crimson was unsure of what it was that he saw in her sharpened eyes. Whatever it was, it attempted to hide an inescapable sense of dread and despair."

Determined not to look back even for an instance, he walked away until his family's pleas were a distant rumble muffled by the wind-blown sand, and he was alone. All that stood ahead of him was a long, narrow road down to the nearest depot.\n\nWhile walking down the hillside, a familiar face came running behind him, and before he could brush him off, he was ambushed with a hug that paralyzed him. \"I'm not going to try and stop you.\", he said with a strained voice. \"I just want to know why.\"\n\nSharru-Ukin gave his brother a sideways glance and sighed, holding up the Book of Revelation. \"In truth, Tiglath, I'm not entirely sure. A bug has been biting me ever since the Manedalusians came. I believe they'd refer to it as a sense of divine providence.\"\n\n\"So are you ash-shuhūd now?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\", he replied. Searching for some assurance, he flipped through the early parts of the book, to a particular passage that had held his mind hostage since he first read it. \"The Book speaks of a certain calling within the spirit that manifests in all creatures, regardless of their creed. A sense of driven destiny that once rooted in the mind, cannot be shaken. The Manedalusian soldier that came by the farmstead spoke of it; it's why she volunteered as well. They seem to believe that all true religions guide creatures to this calling: to protect what is true and proper.\" Closing the Book of Revelation and clutching it close to his chest, the donkey looked up. \"I'm sorry. It's the most I can say to justify myself.\"\n\nWiping a single tear from his face and nodding with grim resolution, Tiglath reached into his pocket and placed a little trinket in his sibling's hoof: an old locket medallion with no picture within its frame. When he got close, he hugged him again. \"Be safe, Sharru. Write back to us, if you can, and come back. Please.\"\n\nHolding the medallion tight, Sharru-Ukin adjusted the rifle on his back, and looked out past the hillside."

  manedalusia.73.d:0 "When the palace was surrounded, the Guard held their ground for as long as they could, but eventually all would succumb to repeated assaults from the Manedalusian soldiers. The walls had been shelled by artillery fire until large sections of the upper halls crumbled under their own weight, and the central courtyard had been flattened to a field of broken tiles. Panthera had grown quiet ever since the siege began. When the Army first came, there was a constant buzz of distant screaming and gunfire throughout the city that echoed to the palace, and a wall of fire as the madponies fought their way to the center of the city. But the constant sounds had stopped many days ago, and the fires burned away the outer portions of the city until nothing was left. The palace guard protected Queen Catrina and her court even as the Manedalusians breached the entrance hall, and fought valiantly to the last. They were offered no mercy, nor courtesy, for their courage.\n\nWhen Catrina was finally found and dragged kicking and screaming out of the palace and into the destroyed courtyard, she was uncerimoniously bound, gagged and dumped in the back of a vehicle, and then driven to a quaint hilltop overlooking the capital from afar. There, she met the stallion responsible for this slaughter.\n\nHe did not offer much in the way of words. Even his eyes didn't have much vitriol for the aristocat, only a grim sense of determination and an ember of hatred that had burned brightest long before he laid his eyes on her. Without giving her a chance to say anything in turn, Crimson Sayf ordered the Queen to be bound to a post erected near the top of the hill, where the breeze blew harshly and brought with it flecks of soot and ash from Panthera's blackened remains. When their work was done, the Queen secured and left to ponder the despoiled countryside and city, Sayf simply said: \"By Ash-Shahid's will, when your body is found, no creature will know your name. But I hope they know, at the very least, that you lived long enough to see your world die.\"\n\nSayf and his soldiers immediately left thereafter, leaving the Queen to wither in solitude. Letting out a deep sigh and staring dead-eyed at the road ahead, Sayf returned to the frontlines, to see the rest of this divine decree carries through to its end."

Once they reached their rallying point, joint exercises would be held with the rest of the Manedalusian armed forces, and Mehmet had been relegated to artillery drills. Of course. That was his natural aptitude, not to mention the talent he had spent his life honing. Still, it made him feel somewhat out of place among the zebras.\n\nHaving taken a sudden interest in the ways of the Koltāliba, the Grandmistress had been so kind as to give him a copy of an old tome from the temple library, a volume penned many centuries ago, in the midst of the First Age of Humility, by one of the most influential Grandmasters of the Order. It outlined a series of fighting and training techniques that the Koltāliba had formalized and kept as traditions, some of which may even have origins in ancient Zonicia from which most Manedalusian zebras descend. The philosophy of the Koltāliba is that of denial: of pleasure, of hatred, of passion, of all earthly things except for the body's strengthening. If Mehmet was to impress them, and maintain his reputation as a member of the armed forces, he had to understand them on their own terms. He had to learn of their ways.\n\nWhenever he had free time, he would continue reading, until he had absorbed the book from cover to cover. He had learned a great deal about the basic fighting techniques that Koltāliba members made use of in their martial arts. But theoretical knowledge is simply not enough.

Are my allegiances in doubt?\"\n\n\"No\", she sighed, putting down the cup. \"There's hardly a pony in this shore more dedicated to the homeland than yourself. You'd consider yourself a nationalist, no?\" Sayf nodded ever so slowly, like he wasn't entirely sure of the phrasing, to which Qamar continued: \"Well, then you should know better than anypony that nations are not governments, nor are they even land; they're people. They're our people, Sayf, and they need our help. I need to know that I can count on you to assist me to that effect.\"\n\nVelvet always had a knack for rhetoric, and it seems her angle worked wonders. Sayf narrowed his eyes, and retorted: \"My loyalty to Al-Manedalus is not up for question; of that, I can assure you. Khaldun and the others were willing to give you their support, and should you fail, the blame falls on their shoulders, not mine. So, very well, miss Velvet. Me and the Sultanate's supporters won't be causing you grief\", he leaned in closer. \"as long, of course, as you fulfill your promise.\"\n\nCrimson's words gave Qamar a measure of relief.

If we agree to the offer, Manedalusia and Maregypt will sign a binding treaty, in which we will formally rescind our claims to the Manedalusian homeland.

He could hardly believe they were now in control of the Imperial Hills.\n\nThe Green Bay's waters waves softly against the hull. As he and several others boarded the vessel, Adaan clutched the butt of his provided service rifle, like he could scarcely believe it was really in his hooves.

Had slavery driven him insane?\n\nIt was during the trip to their rallying point in Garneightah that Adaan finally had the chance to read the Book of Revelation. He did not know much of this creative spirit, nor was he convinced, in the strictest terms, that he had become a true believer.

With a warm smile she replied: \"I'm glad you've made it safely to us, Your Highness. If you would like, me and the generals would be more than happy to give you a tour of the harbor and downtown. You should also meet the Mufti, if you have any questions on what you've read about our faith so far.\"\n\nThe alicorn and her escort, Pinkie, went ahead with Qamar, and Moonstriker offered to give them a ride around the city. Sayf, on the other hoof, stood silent and appeared less than impressed. With a raised eyebrow, he asked Khaldun: \"Is this how all Equestrians are like?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be such a killjoy, Sayf\", Armil chuckled. \"Has Manedalusian hospitality degraded so much that we can't offer a genuine smile to the Princess? She seems quite enthusiastic about coming over.\"\n\nThe visit carried on without a hitch, and the Princess of Friendship departed from the Golden Coast with a good impression, at the very least.

The looming shadow that fell upon the nation came as quickly as it went, and though the refreshing sunlight of midday was promptly returned to the heavens, the sudden passage of the darkness skipped a beat in everypony's heart, from the busiest street near the harbor of Coltoba, to the most isolated village deep in the desert reaches of the Kom Marebo, to the quietest flatland in the green fields of Sineighi. The event appeared to them as a distorted eclipse: though the curved body that passed by the heavens in a swift motion appeared to be the Moon, it bore an uncanny malice in its visage unlike the darkest night ever displayed. What started off as a normal and inconsequential day across Manedalusia came to a sudden halt, as all the ash-shuhūd witnessed this foreboding omen pass them by. At the height of the eclipse, when the sunlight had been fully blocked and only a bright halo shun through the edges of the celestial body, there was a blink; a feeling of freezing dread that straightened the spines of every pony that saw it. It was as if the All-Witnessing's own Eye winked, and by His grace reordered the world such that this nightmare came to a merciful end all the sooner.\n\nThe national silence was broken by screams and cries. The younger foals and fillies wailed, their parents shielding them from unseen things, and among the most educated of the faithful, an existential horror dawned once the petrifying instinctual terror of the event was over. All across Al-Manedalus, desperate ponies, local Muftis and their assistants flipped frantically through the pages of the Book of Revelation, in search of what this could possibly mean, but to Manedalusians at large, only once possible interpretation sank to the bottom of their minds: they were witnessing the end of days."

The Day of Black Sun was a dark omen, but even in its zenith, she had felt Ash-Shahid's gaze still watching over all ash-shuhūd. It was He who stepped forward to undo this nightmare, whatever had caused it, and His message was clear. This was no time to panic. It was time for action.\n\nThe national crisis precipitated by the Black Sun sent the newly established civilian government into utter disarray, but not all hope was lost. Still recovering from the shock, Samira found Velvet and the general staff in short order, and though disappointed, everyone present knew that such a radical display of divine providence demanded an equally radical shift in direction.

He had never been there before; usually their verbal spats were semi public affairs. When he did knock on her door and she carefully peeked outside before quickly letting him in, he was both surprised and intrigued by the state of her laboratory. It was in disarray, something that no matter how much slack he gave the would be alchemist, he would've never expected from her. And given the mare's haggard state, with her uncombed mane tied in a tail and her heavy eyes slouching from side to side over the cluttered desk, like she'd barely slept since the Eclipse, it painted a grim picture of how she'd spent the last few weeks.\n\n\"We were never on the best of terms, sir,\", came her slow, measured response as she grabbed her notes. \"and I have no doubt that will not change in the future. But for the time being, I think it's time we put our disagreements aside.\"\n\nThe Mufti nodded, and took a glance across the scribbled notes that Moonstriker passed over; astronomical data that confirmed, among other things, what the Mufti already knew: the Eclipse was impossible. The Moon and Sun's trajectories, though ever fickle under the influence of the Equestrian Princesses, remained reliable enough to predict these kinds of events, and a proper, natural eclipse would not be visible in the shores of Manedalusia for a good few years to come. \"I know your preference for the Mutazilite position,\", continued the mare. \"but I don't think a reasonable stallion such as yourself would cling to doctrine in the face of direct observation of His work.

Why are we acting as if everything is normal?\"\n\nMuhtal was ready for a reprimand, as was her superior's usual response to insubordination, but instead, Sayf leaned back on his chair and mulled over the question for a few moments. \"I am a soldier, Muhtal.

I don't pretend to be a great philosopher; but I go by an addage that Khaldun once said to me: that our place in the world was made for us, and that we were created for its fulfillment, whatever it may be. No matter how dire things get, I believe no good can be gained from failing to do our part. My part is here; and if you have any doubts as to where you belong, the option for resignation is always available.

Khaldun himself was the only Council member present at this 'gathering'; Sayf was occupied keeping things together among the armed forces, and Laylah hadn't left her laboratory in days.

If we ignored their warnings, and they were correct...\"\n\nSamira both shuddered and ranged at the thought. A millenium ago, when Manedalusia was partitioned by the Maregyptians, the Nightmare waged its war in the lands across the sea. The ash-shuhūd were in no position to oppose it then. To think that once again the Outer Night seeped into Creation...\n\n\"We cannot afford passivity.\", she announced. \"I want every sanctioned scholar of renown to be in agreement.

No other interpretation is sound.\"\n\n\"But what will we do?\", Armil questioned. \"Would you have us take up arms?\"\n\n\"I-\" Samira took a moment to reflect: Al-Manedalus still struggled to get back on its own hooves.

What could they possibly hope to achieve against this Solar Empire?\nThe moment of silence was all it took to restore the Grandmistress' composure. When Ash-Shahid's faithful journeyed in pilgrimage through the lands of the Tyrants of Braylon, He sent lightning to smash their walls; when they languished under foreign subjugation, His voice gave them the strength to resist; when they despaired, His benevolence brought plentiful sunlight to the Golden Goast and joy back into their hearts. Heeding His word had always carried them through their trials - and it would do so again."

No calamity had befallen the nation since that dark day, and every pony had passed these last few weeks in dreadful antecipation. The realization of the omen's true meaning had been slowly dawning over them; the Sun's influence had shifted inauspiciously since that fateful day, that dreadful day when the Equestrian Princess ascended to Empress, into this so called \"Daybreaker\". The All And Ever-Witnessing had sent no omen of destruction; rather, he had sent them a call to action. And in the capital, the gathered ponies' emotions twisted from fear to rage as these rumors spread, and their fervors were stoked by the wretched warmth of the tainted sunlight.\n\nThe Mufti of Coltoba had found fitting precedent, not in the Fiqh, but in old legends for such things; the Qadi, though somberly, did not contradict him. The Koltāliba had long since accepted the omen's true significance, and with the military Council's final word of approval, the time had come to call all of Manedalusia to arms in this dire hour. Crimson Sayf, with his fellow generals by his side, was the one to address the gathered crowd in the name of the military government.\n\n\"Ponies of Coltoba!\", he announced with a raised hoof and a terrible shout. \"Ever since the dawn of our nation, when we hiked through the deserts to the marketplaces of the East, when we sailed through the Green Bay to the bountiful shores of North Zebrica, the sun has always been our faithful companion. Its light has always blessed the Golden Coast, and fair Al-Manedalus has long since known, ever since the days the Sultans of Everleaf ruled from Coltoba, that in our darkest hours its light would guide us forward. And now, Ash-Shahid calls upon us to defend the Sun's sanctity; across the ocean, in the land of Equestria, its rightful custodian has been usurped by a vile demon of the Outer Night! Its unholy rot taints the sunrays, and all the faithful can feel it!\nWhen we gained our independence, we believed the new millenium would give us respite from our woes; but all can see now that our great trial has just begun. All things align for a reason, and our purpose in this new age is to smite the Darkness that festers within our world. This shall be our stand; Ash-Shahid tests us, and so help us, we will NOT be found wanting!\"\n\nThe crowd's passions had been fully stoked, and with the lingering sensation they all felt within corroborated, every gathered pony raised their hooves and screamed out curses to the Djinn Empress. Manedalusia's ponies prepared to raise the darkened battle standards of their own Sun, as they did in ages past; the time has come for a renewed Holy War."

They would've expected some sort of treachery, had they not been explicitly told to bring whatever protection they deemed adequate. With this in mind, the Council's members boarded Grifo's flagship flanked by a personal guard and received barely even a passing glance from the anxious crew as they made their way to the bridge. They found the mysterious griffon waiting for them by his lonesome, drinking some hard liquor and looking measurably sour, like he had a giant weight upon his shoulers.\nGrifo introduced himself properly, revealing he was born in Cyanolisia, in the tiny island outpost of Espelho Mar. He seemed rather calm throughout, though he spoke with a sense of grief and dreadful gravitas. After the introduction and assorted pleasantries, he said plainly: \"I apologize, sincerely, if my sudden appearance during the Coup caused concern among you. I am honorbound not to betray my contacts, so I cannot tell you how I learned of your plans, only that I did so on rather short notice, hence my abrupt arrival and ill preparedness to assist you. But I have no ill intent towards you, or your people. In fact, I wish only to help.\"\nWith reasonable skepticism, it was Khaldun that spoke up. \"You must understand our apprehension, sir. We have gone to great lengths to secure Manedalusia's freedom, and your presence here has so far inspired little confidence. What is it, exacly, that you want to help us with?\"\nGrifo let out a weak, desperate chuckle. \"I wish I could explain it to you, my friend, I truly do. I always fashioned my eloquence as among the few virtues that I possess. But... I fear you wouldn't believe me.\"\n\"We cannot tolerate ambiguity,\" said Sayf. \"even from the supposedly well meaning. State your terms, as clearly as you can. Otherwise, our talks can go nowhere.\"\n\"I agree that talk alone is cheap\", replied the griff in short order. \"which is why action must be sorely taken. I'm sorry for my boldness. Time is shorter than you recognize it to be. For the sake of us all, I've placed our fate at the whims of the gods. We will all have to take this leap of faith. Together.\"\n\"Pardon? What does that mean?\"\nGrifo did not respond. He looked both sad and staunchly resolute in those last few seconds of tranquility; and the moment of trial came and went in an instant. Sayf's guts caught wind of the imminent threat, but he only had time to yell for his colleagues to duck for cover. Though he reached for his service pistol, he was too slow to fire. All throughout, Grifo remained serene, and placed himself blindly at the mercy of Fate."

Though the celebrations in Coltoba and beyond were ecstatic, the time has now come for a most somber matter to be decided upon: how we will deal with the aristocats of the Kingdom and their responsibility for their crimes.\n\nThough Manedalusia has outlawed slavery since the times of the Sultans of Everleaf, we were ourselves complicit in that trade, even if long ago. It would perhaps be hypocritical to cast too harsh a judgement on all slaveowners; after all, no two are equal. Recent testimony from emancipated former slaves is varied. For a select few, undue cruelty even beyond that which this foul practice requires for its sustainment gives us more than enough reason to allow the new Protectorate administration to punish them to the harshest degree. For others, a measure of restraint and grace towards their lessers, even despite their complicity as slaveowners, might absolve them of culpability - legal, at the very least, if not wholly moral; guilt and redemption are matters between a creature and the divine alone.\n\nThere is, of course, still the option of total and complete punishment for all Abyssinian slaveowners, regardless of individual testimony or circumstance. It'd be a hard legal argument to make, given the technicalities of slavery in Abyssinian law. Still, its proponents make a case for an exceptionless purge of all complicit in slavery; it would show the world, if nothing else, that we are not soft nor complacent when it comes to our application of Harmony and its principles. Ultimately, it will be the administration's choice to make."

Staring straight through him, she did not say a word for what felt to Grifo like an eternity. Eventually, he shrugged. \"Are you expecting something out of me?\"\n\nThe Grandmistress fondled a small revolver in her hooves, visibly holding back the urge to shoot him dead right then and there. \"Out of a cowardly creature like you, I did expect something. A plea for mercy, perhaps.\"\n\nGrifo chuckled and raised his head, accepting his fate should the Grandmistress decide to fire the round. \"I came to this land on a mission, and to achieve it, I was prepared to sacrifice everything, including my life. I will not beg for mercy from you, ma'am. You are as bound by your creed as I am by mine, and even if I were inclined to degrade myself, I doubt you could be persuaded.\"\n\n\"Then before I deliver you your just fate, answer me\", she demanded. \"Why? Why all of this? What did you possibly hope to achieve?\"\n\nMulling over the answer, Grifo said: \"I suppose I hoped to achieve something beyond happiness in complacency. In the south of Griffonia, I lived comfortably; but I wanted something that wealth and content living cannot provide. I desired glory.\"\n\n\"Glory...\", Samira repeated with an enraged snarl, and holding back immense fury, she quietly replied: \"I suppose it's fitting, then, how inglorious your death will be.\"\n\nFollowing that brief exchange, Samira and her followers marched the bound griffon to freshly erected gallows in the temple courtyard, where his friends awaited him. They had been true in their promise to follow this quest through to whatever its end, and not one complaint came out of them.\nGrifo's final thoughts were of home, and of what destiny awaited the world he was leaving behind."

Even after his coronation. the mare always referred to him by name, not title; though Sayf found her boldness annoying, that boldness also made her a valuable asset. It was for this reason that after much deliberation, he decided to offer Moonstriker an opportunity he knew she'd never refuse.\n\n\"You mean it?!\", she said with excitement.\n\n\"Of course\", replied Sayf. \"I could think of no better person for this task than you. Maretania's a strange land, and the Obsidian Council's purposes are still unclear to us. However, they certainly dabbled heavily in magical studies, and their state was an effective magocracy. Rather than restructure their administration and strain our control more than we have to, I believe the best course of action is to adopt their practices. You shall be the Guardianship's representative, and - within reason - the sovereign of the new Riseian state.\"\n\nUpon calling her 'sovereign', Laylah got a barely contained pleasurable expression. \"May I have the honor of claiming a proper title?\" The Sultan, shrugging, gave an approving gesture, to which she replied: \"Under the Sultanate's purview, I would like for Riseia to be instated as a principality; and I, its princess.\"\n\nThe suggestion almost drove the Sultan to laughter. \"Very well, Laylah. Or should I say, Princess Laylah of Riseia. I must stress that your duties shall be dual; you are still an officer of the Manedalusian Army. Are you certain you're up to the task of heading a state, in addition to your current duties?\"\n\nBowing her head and hiding her devious smile, Laylah responded: \"Of course, Sayf.\""

  manedalusia.94.d:0 "Jade Luminescence was a strange mare. A reclusive hermit to most, the Sultan only ever heard of her by happenstance. As one of the very, very few thestrals in Al-Manedalus, she's an exile that escaped Chiropterra, putting her life in grave danger, and found respite and refuge in our lands. Tales of Chiropterrans expats who fled their regime are not entirely without precedent, but what made Jade so unique was her willing adoption of Manedalusian religion, having been accepted into the ash-shuhūd congregation some weeks after her settlement in Sinehighi. According to her, when she crossed the Tobuckian border and fled patrols until she reached the Zarantian desert, hugging the Green Bay, she received a divine revelation whose meaning she could not grasp until she came to our lands, then under the rule of Maregypt. Days of deliberation, combined with the warmth of ash-shuhūd hospitality, drove her to believe whole-heartedly in Ash-Shahid's divinations. In this respect, she is, to our knowledge, one of a kind, as a Chiropterran born ash-shuhūd.\n\nHer reasons to flee were her own, but that unique background has made her quite the asset, now that Chiropterra lies defeated at our hooves and their fanatical population now falls under our purview. Through her faith, Jade's loyalty to Al-Manedalus is not up for questioning, but her nationality makes her the perfect mediator between the Guardianship and Chiropterrans themselves. As such, the Sultan has gracefully chosen her to lead the Committee for National Purification, an ambitious project to slowly proselytize Chiropterrans away from the worship of the Night. Though the chance of success of this project is up for questioning, Jade was enthusiastic to lead it, and the select scholars, army officers and personnel selected to assist her were all chosen for their commitment to the proselytizing mission. It will take time, and the work will be arduous, but the Sultan hopes that the barbarous beliefs of the Nightmare worshippers can at long last be extinguished for good."

But to her surprise, once the Koltāliba had been slaughtered to the last, she had instead been taken captive, and taken back to the flagship. Once she got a chance to look at this detestable creature in the flesh, she could not hold back visible disgust. She had nothing but contempt for the heathen, and his indulgence of some sense of nobility only enraged her further. \"Just kill me, and throw my body to the water.\"\n\nThe suggestion made the griffon visibly shudder. \"Even after all that has happened, would you believe me, miss, if I said I had no wish to harm you? I wish only to help, and it's with a heavy heart that I take these necessary steps.\"\n\n\"To help?\", Samira asked indignantly. \"You wished to help us by killing the Council, leaving us vulnerable, preying on the people of Coltoba like thieves?! Are you mad?!\"\n\n\"Mad...\", Grifo pondered the word. \"Yes, I suppose I am. I am mad, for wanting greatness that luck alone does not provide. What are we, miss, without a little dash of madness? Just late corpses that breed?\"\n\nThough Grifo asked the question in earnest, to the Grandmistress, it seemed like some insane provocation. However, when the griffon leaned in close to her, she found the perfect opportunity to shake her hoof free from the loose restraints, and lunge at him with all her remaining might.\n\nThe two of them wrestled over control of Grifo's gun, until finally, he fired off a shot that silenced the Grandmistress for good. Recomposing himself and standing over the body, Grifo voiced a silent prayer to the gods, assuring himself that this act of treachery was his last.\n\nAll the machinations of Fate had led him here. Through all of his gambles, he succeeded, and the blessings of Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr seemed now more than apparent. The civilizing light now stood a chance, free from opposition; and Grifo found it truly regretable that all this had to be done to achieve it."

The remaining ones had either lost all trust in Grifo, or even all hope for the imperial rejuvenation. These close few friends were all that Grifo had left to rely on.\n\nThe atmosphere aboard the flagship was somber indeed, but Grifo, taken by a sudden burst of emotion, let slip a tear. \"Even after all this time, some of you came. Not many, but more than enough to fill an old griffon's heart.\" Steadying himself with disciplinary stoicism, Grifo took a deep breath. \"I won't lie to you, friends. The journey ahead of us will be long and arduous. Difficulties will beset us at every step of the way. No creature in this part of Zebrica, save for the catfolk, their prejudices stoked by the barbarous Wingbardians, understands the splendour of Karthinia. We will have few friends in this land. I understand if your hearts falter at the thought, but... as it stands, mixed feelings or hesitancy make you a liability. If you wish to leave, I will not resent you; and if you choose to stay here with me, to try our luck at molding from this clay a new thing of beauty, then you commit yourself all the way. There can be no backing out after that. So, are you with me?\"\n\nThe replies came so quick as to extinguish any fear of doubt among them. Despite their predicament, they were happy.

By good fortune, he has finally found himself in a suitable position to enact what he knows to be his true purpose. All the sorrows and tribulations, all the mistakes and setbacks, all the tremendous risks - they have finally brought him here, to the land of Manedalusia, and to Coltoba - soon to be New Karthin.\nThe world stood still in anxious antecipation. By the will of the gods, Grifo and his allies had secured in Zebrica a beachhead of civilization, the bulwark of true Imperium; but as it stood, all they had was a tiny, fragile ember. Surrounded by enemies and barbarians on all sides, with the Eternal City seeming as distant as it could possibly be, even now, all their hopes stood on the brink of an inescapable precipice. If Grifo failed, if this new dominion he carved could not be molded into something greater, it is likely destiny would not grant him a second chance to try. But so be it; what great things were ever accomplished from a safe and riskless position? To fear the risk of failure is the attitude of one already defeated. Woe to the content in their circumstances, to those who continue to live solely because they're alive already! The Dominion of the Overseas would survive, it would forge in Zebrica the foundations of the Universal Empire, and return in glory to sacred Karthin; or Grifo would die with it.\n\nIt was time for action.

The lower floors were built like an intentional maze, and the fanatical zebras warrior monks, with such an extreme home advantage, would be sure to slaughter a poorly coordinated assault. Knowing that decisive action had to be taken to deal with the threat, it was concluded that the best and only option was to commit all available forces to a full assault after surrounding and cornering the Koltāliba.\n\nThe days of preparation were spent in dreadful antecipation.

He had sustained some burns and nearly lost an eye to flying shrapnel, but despite placing himself in mortal danger, he had escaped largely unharmed. He felt somewhat ashamed; the Manedalusians had fought bravely for their freedom, and still he betrayed their trust for his gain. He had to make it up somehow.\n\nHaving some talks with his subordinates while the ship's bridge was cleared and his wounds tended to, Grifo took a long, measured look out to the harbor, to the city of Coltoba, and to the looming palace in the rocky hills. He could never have guessed, all those years ago when he first began this long quest, that Fate would guide him here to the shores of Zebrica, to a land where sacred Karthin's light was distant and diffuse.

While it wasn't unheard of for even the likes of al-Manesūr to be in such a good mood, what did surprise Khaldun, along with the rest of his colleagues, were the good spirits that Sayf was in. When Velvet made her way outside, the stallion made an effort to welcome her. \"How were things with the Equestrian ambassador, Qamar?\"\n\n\"He gave us a hard time over the delegation!\", she laughed. \"But in the end, it was all for the best.\"\n\nIt hadn't been often in the last few years that the group enjoyed some off time to reflect and to fraternize, much less without the looming threat of some responsibility or other.

Do you think history will look upon us kindly, Armil?\"\n\nKhaldun suppressed a chuckle. \"It's unwise to ponder such things too much, Sayf. I find that we tend to treat the past with both contempt and reverence. People are fickle, and seldom willing to put themselves in another's place, to think as they might have. History is never particularly kind to its subjects, no matter what they do.\" Taking a sip while staring out past the harbor's waters, Khaldun got a glimmer in his eye. \"I will tell you this, though: the past resembles the future more than one drop of water resembles another. Whether they look kindly on us or not, future generations will follow our example, and watch our play with great interest. And truly, is there any greater honor one could ask for?\"\n\n\"Hmm.\", cranking a smile, Sayf nodded. \"I suppose you're right. Well then...

Ominous clouds parted the heavens over the city, but the sun shined brightly through them on the white building at the heart of Karthin; and all eyes turned to the top of the steps, where the harpy priest of Boreas raised a claw to the crowd and proclaimed, as the imperial aquilas were unfurled to the naked breeze, the birth of the true Imperium.\n\nAs the griffons of Karthin watched on in awe and terror, Rosa turned to Grifo. \"I don't know what is more daunting to imagine: the path we've already treaded, or the work still left to be done.\"\nFernão chuckled and adjusted his suit's tie. \"The gods first want, then us mortals make it so, Rosa, my dear. Such is how all great works are born. I believe that from the very start, we had good fortune on our side. Our mission is holy, after all, and the gods watch over their own. The path doesn't seem so long with that in mind, does it?\"\n\"Will they watch you as Lord-Regent?\", she asked.\n\n\"Hmm... Certainly.\", Grifo stared off to nothing, past the mass of the gathered crowd and up towards the cloudy skies over the temple. \"Griffonia awaits us with is its breath held now. Our time remains ever short. I can only hope that our time in Zebrica has made of each of us a worthy leader, myself included.\"\nOut of the blue, Rosa asked him: \"Do you fear that we may die, Fernão?\"\n\nThe question stunned him momentarily, but not before long, he laughed softly, replying: \"I have never feared death, Rosa. I fear, most of all, having lived without having done my best; and the gods above know, there is yet much to be done.\""

  manedalusia.109.d:0 "Diyana flipped through the pages of the Book of Revelation in search of further insight. Every couple of minutes, she took a small pause to gaze longingly down the hillside path and towards her town, nestled in the rocky shore. The temporary isolation gave her respite, and a chance to think clearly about things. Reading over the previously reviewed pages, checking through her own hasty notes, she cross referenced the word of Ash-Shahid with the translated text the strange preacher had given her. In Boreas, she saw the commanding divinity of the All-Witnessing; in Eyr, His love; in Arcturius, His might. But no matter how much she dabbled in this new religion, she could not quite make sense of the notion. When she perused the creation myth, which she had been warned was meant not to be taken at face value, Diyana could not extrapolate the mechanistic functions of Griffonkind's Creation into any deeper truth. On this point, Tritheism seemed like superstitious nonsense of a foreign people.\n\nAsh-Shahid's creation was made in His own mental image, but could other peoples' gods truly bear significance? The Mufti would've had her slapped for the mere suggestion, but the more Diyana considered it, the more sense it made; she knew for as long as she lived that the All-Witnessing's Oneness cannot be fully grasped by mortal kind, much in the same way a narrow and shortsighted look cannot fully comprehend the scale of any large object. To present Himself to His creations, He made use of His many aspects, each communicating a small part of His all encompassing whole. Could it be that across the seas, the divine entities the griffons had contrived were actually real? She saw no reason why Ash-Shahid would neglect any creature's spirit; and so, perhaps it truly was that His revelations came to them through His aspects, taking on a different but parallel form.\n\nThe sun was setting, and Diyana's parents would be back soon. She knew they'd never tolerate her thinking such heretical things. As was her routine, she hid the preacher's book under the mound of rocks and leaves by her solitary tree in the hillside, before hurrying back home."

When the Dominion government was made aware of this, they were expecting a riot in the making, but what was unfolding was much more bizarre; they had elected from among their number not a Mufti, but a Prelate.\n\nAuthorities were quick to investigate the matter, and discover that through the government's initiative to promote literacy among the populace, many ponies across Manedalusia had gotten their hooves on copies of Tritheist religious texts, provided by the Macawian António's sect. Of their own volition, a strange syncretism had been forged in the private homes and public gathering spaces of Manedalusia; though the textual interpretations, once they made their way back to António, revealed the clear influence from ash-shuhūd theology - particularly the ponies' insistence on refering to each of the gods as an aspect of monolithic divinity - a consensus had nonetheless been achieved, much to his pleasure. With minimal intervention from the authorities, Manedalusians had been largely converting to and accepting Tritheism, on their own terms.\n\nWith a quick stamp of approval from the Lord-Governor, the new Prelate of New Karthin was officially sanctioned by the state and the city's old temple leased back to the community for renovations. In time, the native populace would be practicing the faith with renewed fervor, though what form this new sect might take is still up for any creature to guess. As it stands, however, the success of the proselytizing initiative was unquestionable; not only has near universal Literacy been achieved, so has religious unity."

He was always an intellectual, and never particularly prone to athletics, but ever since his bones started aching when he stretched that he had accepted he was an old griff long past his prime. It was no feather off his tail: such is the scheme of life. However, his recent escapades had given him a newfound strength that the griffon found shockingly revitalizing.\n\nThe army life was alien to him. Commanding troops, giving orders, long restless night relaying battlefield commands while playing mind games with the enemy, all these things Grifo had explored in the abstract, in the safety of a library hall or his private study, but to experience it, to properly live it, was both humbling and empowering. Grifo found that he no longer struggled to get out of bed in the morning, nor did his bones ache when he stretched the tips of his wings. He spoke more clearly, felt more confident in his words, and the troops now felt a measure to true respect when he strode past them. He was no longer restrained to the role of a paperpusher or a thinker; the military life had worked its course, and after all he and his fellows had accomplished in Zebrica, Grifo now felt truly worthy of the title of Lord-Governor.\n\nReflecting on the past few years while enjoying a quiet afternoon free of responsibilities, Rosa Branca caught him off guard when she asked: \"Do tell, Fernão, how come you don't have a glass on your talon? I think I've hardly ever seen you enjoying the view without one.\"\n\nGrifo's words got stuck in his throat when he tried to reply. The fact he wasn't drinking was just as surprising to him as it was to the mare. He had barely even noticed it, but he simply hadn't felt the urge to have a drink for quite some time. \"I suppose I've taken a liking to full sobriety, Rosa.\"\n\n\"Oh, Grifo...\", she giggled. \"Don't tell me you're starting to lose your joy of life.\"\n\nJumping up from his chair with youthful vigor and sporting a wide grin, Grifo retorted. \"On the contrary, my dear...\""

The crowd of gathered Manedalusians hung on his every word, and when he spoke, each pony anxiously awaited the thought's resolution as eagerly as if it were their own. By the end of the speech, he had them riled to an emotional frenzy, and the perfect carthasis was delivered when he at last said: \"...and now your brethren return to you, free at last!\"\n\nThere were cheers and tears in equal measure. The slaves the Dominion's Army had gathered from the occupied territories of Abyssinia had already been slowly been returning to the heart of Manedalusia, accompanied by military escorts, but the way the harpy preacher's words stung the crowd, one would think he delivered them their stolen family and friends back from the realm of the dead. They were enthralled, and in that soft sovereignty of the passions of others there is true power: the power of unbending, honorbound loyalty.\n\nThe Overseas Dominion was no longer a weakling ember, but a burning passionate fire across Western Zebrica.

Among the many concessions to the palace guard of Griffenheim, a small contingent of the Emperor's personal guard, fiercely loyal Bronzehill dogs, were allowed to keep their arms and accompany the child emperor on his journey south. The atmosphere was undoubtedly tense all throughout the ride, but it went without incident until the young Grover was delivered unharmed to the Lord-Regent's manor. When they first saw each other, Grifo maintained a professional half-smile that had the guard dogs confused, and Grover seemed, at the very least, not scared; puzzled, maybe.\n\n\"Do you understand why you've been brought here, My Emperor?\" Grover did not respond verbally, though he did nod. \"I believe your previous custodians must've told you terrible things would happen to you. Perhaps your current guard even believe so as we speak.\", the Lord-Regent scanned through the dogs, each of them looking ready to charge him, at the risk of their own life, if he even laid a careless talon on the boy. \"But you've been lied to, my Emperor. I've bought you south to sacred Karthin to keep you safe. You have been destined for great things, things that you could not possibly achieve if you were confined to Griffenheim. But before we discuss that further... I've arranged to take you, and your guard, on a trip around Karthin.\"\n\nTaking Alexandre's advice, Grifo decided to keep his own thoughts to himself for the moment, and the young Emperor seemed at least partially receptive to the courtesy he had been shown, even if the dogs did not. With the rightful Emperor secured, time was no longer critical; Fernão would have the chance to take things slowly, to gradually shape the young Emperor's mind in the right direction. For the moment, it sufficed that he felt comfortable in his soon to be new home in sacred Karthin. With good fortune and proper mentoring, he was certain that the child would achieve great things - soon enough, he'd perhaps willingly cast aside his barbarian name."

If blood mattered for anything, why would I tolerate non-griffons in the Holy Empire's design?\" António gave pause for thought, but Fernão continued: \"Do you think it's simply the royal line itself we wintend to take from Herzland? What we need is the soul of its being, the gestalt, the spirit! The line of Griffonstone's value is thymotic, immaterial in its entirety; it's what it represents that matters. And that is why it must live on, no matter what.\"\n\nAntónio looked closely at the child from balcony as the manor guards gave it toys to play with. \"The resemblance is remarkable, I must say. Where did you find him?\"\n\n\"At an orphanage in Griffenheim. His given name is Henrik, though I believe he can be slowly disillusioned of his Herzlander heritage with time. The plan proceeds exactly as it has so far.\"\n\n\"And what if he finds out?\"\n\n\"Find out?\", Grifo questioned. \"I do not intend to keep it secret from him. When he is old enough to take the throne, he will understand the weight of that responsibility. The real Grover would've had to shed that barbarian identity just the same, wouldn't he?.\"\n\nThe harpy sighed, and accepted, though begrudgingly, Grifo's proposition.

A crowd had gathered under in the public yard just in front of the palace, bringing griffons from across the Western and Eastern reaches of the Empire. Each of the Dominions sent a delegation with gifts from their myriad lands, food, furniture, weaponry, luxuries and humble goods in equal measure. From the Overseas Dominion, Grifo brought to the young Emperor one particular object that intrigued him; a finely carved though strange symbol cast in gold and suspended in a chain. \"This is the Eye of Ash-Shahid. The ponies of Manedalusia used to pay homage to this deity, before their conversion to the true faith. They believed he watched over and protected them from harm.\"\n\n\"Why are you giving me this, sir?\", the Emperor asked, confused. \"Isn't it just some pointless superstition?\"\n\n\"In a way, yes... but the truth is, my Emperor, even before I came to that land, Manedalusians and us shared a certain appreciation for divine destiny. The ponies were among the first, and most fierce, soldiers of the Overseas Dominion, and even after their conversion, carrying the Eye brought them solace and peace of mind. The gods do watch over us, after all, and the divine has a way of finding its path to the heart of every creature willing to take it in, in some form or other.\"\n\nThe young Emperor took the necklace in his claws and stroked the golden surface of the eye with his talon, before pocketing it and smiling back to the Lord-Regent. \"Thank you, sir. I'll be sure to keep it close to me. But what about you? What will you do now?\"\n\n\"Me?\", Grifo laughed. \"I think my time in politics has dragged on for long enough now, my Emperor. You are within your power to demand my services, of course, but, should you allow me, I believe it is time for me to spend the rest of my years in peace.\"\n\nThe Emperor gave Fernão a nod of approval, and in turn, Fernão unfurled his wing to direct the Emperor to the open balcony.

There he stood, where it all began, and despite all his accomplishments, the glories he brought to Griffonia and beyond through the Universal Empire's completion, he wasn't fully satisfied. Even after all this time, the guilt of his betrayal never left him, and he questioned whether the gods would forgive his transgressions. The soul of the Universal Empire was built off of Karthinia; but in a way, Manedalusia had an equal shared in its spirit. Above all, Grifo wondered whether had he had done had been worth it.\n\nHe would soon be receiving word of the goings on in Griffonia from Rosa and Alexandre. He'd also have to pay a visit to Macawia, to assure the Order's affairs were going smoothly and the harpies assimilated properly.

In the mean time, he thought of his home in Wingpoli, of his colleagues and friends in Sicameon, his sweetheart's words when she voiced concern for him, and his mother... He was getting lost in his thoughts again. It had been many years since he heard of Fernão, and getting an invite to Zebrica of all places had been eating away at him for weeks. Giuseppe figured the old griff had retreated back to whatever hole he crawled out of and given up on his dreams, as did all the old members of the Society. Never would he have guessed that even after all this time, the madgriff was still at it! The pay he was being offered to set up shop in the Abyssinian coast was simply too much to pass up, even if it did mean he'd have to be away from Griffonia for many months.\n\nTaking out a cigarette and sitting on the ferry's deck staring off to the deep blue, Giuseppe thought of what Grifo used to say regarding the spirit of adventure: \"Pity those content in their home, those who continue to live simply because they're already alive, pity those who call themselves happy!\" He was a passionate griff when it came to his speeches, and Giuseppe had to take his time to fully digest most of his words. Now that he was staring the prospect of being away from home for so long, filled with a mixture of liminal terror and exciting antecipation, he believed he finally understood it; that spirit of adventure, that urge for the unfamiliar and the unknown, is the thing that drives all creatures to greatness. Perhaps it was the reason that madgriff hadn't given up, and continued to search across the whole world for a suitable place to begin his work. It was a strangely comforting thought; not enough to fully dissolve the sinking feeling of leaving his homeland behind, but enough at least to bring his anxieties to rest.\n\nClearance came from the portmaster, and with a nod to the captain the ferry left shore and began its long trek across the southern ocean.

  manedalusia.117.d:0 "The Mythos - it's the nothing that is everything. Griffons, creatures of material wants as they often are, tend to neglect the strength and wealth derived from the abstract and the spiritual, but Grifo knew otherwise. Perhaps it was that the gods granted him his talents primarily for that purpose - to weave words and song into solid fabric, capable of sustaining the collective psyche of a whole people. When he read the ancient history of Karthinia, of its myriad political twists and turns, its many enemies, conquests and wars, one thing made itself apparent at every point in the flow of the general scheme: through their darkest hours, what held Karthinia together was that Mythos, the immaterial soul that bound each of its Legion's commanders, soldiers and the wider citizenry, each member of the venerable Senate and each plebian at the edge of the old Empire. All great civilizations were in possession of that soul, and should the Universal Empire hope to last, it'd have to embody each and every virtuous trait that previous generations iterated over the millenia. For such a grand task, such an ambitious undertaking, a single perspective would simply not suffice. Grifo had to draw from several, even contradicting sources within his spirit, and channel each into an Ego of its own, with its own beliefs, its own independent perspective, such that a synthesis could be properly derived from their back and forth struggles.\n\nFernão took a deep breath, and stared longingly into the blank paper in his desk. Silently, he voiced a prayer to Boreas to send him worthy muses, to give him a thunderous voice and a steady claw, a clear and sublime sound clad in the stylish flourish of eloquence. Thinking it over, Grifo came to the conclusion that no less than four main egos had to be built - one of Technology, one of Tradition, one of Nature, and one of Society. Lesser beings would serve these archetypes if need be, but these four had to stand on their own terms, at least.\n\nWith this understanding, Grifo got to work. All begginings are involuntary; it is the gods that guide the path of creation. The griff surrendered his will to that of the divine, and with good fortune, perhaps they'd endow him the strength to finish such a colossal project as the construction of a civilizational soul."

Now, with Harmony triumphant, in part, by the strength of our hooves, the adrenaline and ecstasy of victory begin to slowly melt away. It's hard to say what the future might now hold for us. One thing, however, is certain: when Darkness threatened to swallow the whole world, we resisted its advance, no matter how hopeless it may have seemed, and by His divine grace achieved victory in the Holy War. The scars of our strife remain, and will take their time to heal; all of West Zebrica, in fact, remains frozen in suspense for what might happen next. We can only hope that our trials have ended, and the ash-shuhūd might finally know peace and respite; and should tomorrow hold further challenges to our faith and our tenacity, we will meet them with renewed strength, and the same invisible fire within us that's held against all stormwinds so far."

Despite this, and despite the carnage and turmoil that the relatively sheltered socialite certainly saw, she carried herself with the same grace and levity that she had when they first met. If anything, with the Eclipse's uncertainty so far behind them, she seemed genuinely happier.\n\n\"As was promised, with our mission accomplished, the civilian government can now be reformed and power returned, in part, to the Majlis Ash-Shūrā.

The people of Aris have never interacted in any meaningful capacity with the ponies of Al-Manedalus; our faith is foreign and strange to you, and we understand that our devotion, to outsiders, must seem like a strain of madness. With this in mind, we understand that you must feel apprehensive about our endeavors.\n\nAs of now, we prepare for the culmination of a great trial that has mobilized all of the ash-shuhūd to arms in defence of what we believe to be the very balance of our world; you must certainly be aware of the dire situation that has developed in Equestria, and the betrayal of Princess Celestia - if the so-called Sun Empress can even be considered to be her. We are new to the principles of Harmony, and we do not claim to understand them to a greater degree than you. However, we've always been faithful servants of the universal creative spirit, known to us as the All and Ever-Witnessing, and for over a thousand years that His word, when revealed clearly to mortal kind, has been as good as law among us. And we believe, as single-mindedly as any creature possibly can, that He has called upon us to rise from stupor to Harmony's defence, and when He commands, we obey. To this end, our loyalty to Harmony, whatever form it must take for its survival, is not up for question.\n\nWe humbly request of Aris any war materials and personnel that can be spared, at your state's behest or of your citizens' free volition, to assist in our effort to liberate Equus from the Empress' grasp and restore true Harmony to the heart of Equestria. We have been convinced of the divine sanctity of our mission, and will not be deterred either way, but much as faith is cemented from every little act of good will, all small boons provided to this grand crusade can, and will, add up.

In this moment, it must seem much more appealing to you to stay within the safety of your lands. But while Harmony has suffered an extreme blow, true defeat is not found on a political map - it is psychological. Hope for triumph over the Empress is still palpable on the mainland, and that energy merely awaits the opportunity to be tapped into. While it is still there, we have not lost any ground at all.

My colleagues are universally cheerful, for which I am also grateful, as the lifting of our spirits is, in my view, the greatest reward from any successful campaign. We've risen to the occasion and achieved the nigh impossible, travelled across the ocean, jungles, plains, mountains and more to reach the heart of a foreign land and dislodge a foul entity which threatened the very pillars of Creation. I believe it is fair to say, in a sense, that Al-Manedalus has at long last broken free of its millenial curse; we've stewed for centuries in our supposedly perpetual obscurity, and now stand victorious over the greatest Evil the world has ever known.\n\nWhen I think of what future generations might say of this strange transitional epoch, my mind is most drawn to what kind of message they might take from this tall tale. Many valuable lessons are present in all great epics, but having experienced the euphoria of this era's madness and absurdity in my flesh, I believe the most valuable lesson of all is that of continual humility, even in triumph. What we achieved, we did by divine mandate, as all righteous things ever done always are. When the world seemed taken by Darkness and lost, we held on stubbornly to what we believed to be true and proper, but what allowed this inner strength was not pride, but the humble understanding of our role to play in the scheme. The world may be said to be a stage on which we play our parts, and when our performances are adequate, there is true Harmony.\n\nAs such, to future readers, I say this: when things seem dire and challenges beset you, remember always that no true resilience has ever been produced in pure prosperity, and that adversity is but an opportunity to test the strength of our faith and tenacity.

The army ponies never agreed on all points of governance, but they worked together to pry Manedalusia free of Abyssinia's claws.

Still, everypony in the city was reeling with dread; as far as the countryside knew, the city remained under occupation. It was crucial to assemble all Koltāliba personnel and to muster the armed forces, to secure the border and assure the safety of Coltoba.

His devotion to duty was beyond questioning, but his role as one of the premier spymasters of the Order did make him hesitant to Samira's efforts to bring the Koltāliba into the political spotlight.\n\nZahid's skills and expertise woud still be more than welcome, as Al-Manedalus could not afford to fight its enemies on an equal playing field and expect to win. Against the overhwelming numerical and industrial advantages of its neighbors, what Manedalusia did have was an elite group capable of strategically crippling supply and movement for enemy armed forces. War was always a delicate manner, but Zahid and his acolytes' skills could be use as an even more precise tool to power.\n\nManedalusia was not entirely defenseless.

But now, the situation had irrevocably changed: against all odds, Coltoba stood firm and defeated the Abyssinian army, and now Panthera itself is in the hooves of Manedalusia and the Kingdom's nobility left at their mercy, and by extension, the Grandmistress'.\n\nWhen contemplating on how to deal with the slavers of Abyssinia, Samira's immediate thought was to immediate and all encompassing capital punishment, but it was Mehmet that convinced her to allow for non-martial tribunals and a more lenient, though still strict, sentencing.\n\nFor a select few members of the Abyssinian Mensafint, death would be their fate for their unusual cruelty and continued lobby for the extension of slavery as an institutions; for others, lifelong imprisionment, and for a very few lucky aristocats, the chance to provide monetary compensation and avoid a jail cell. This turn of events left Samira feeling... somewhat strange. Most of all, she felt relief that with the Lion brought to heel, Coltoba could breathe a sigh of relief.

When they had reached the sight of the derailment, Mehmet had immediately begun to coordinate rescue operations and called for army engineering personnel under his command. The crew was found alive, though moderately injured, among the wreckage in short notice, and the military surplus cargo was also recovered in its near entirety. By the time Muhtal and other personnel had reached the scene, all that was left to do was clean-up.\n\nFor his dedication to duty and quick thinking, the Grandmistress saw fit to award Mehmet in some way, and decided to officialize a system of military honors for those who go above and beyond the call of duty. More than anything, Mehmet's quick thinking and solid leadership gave Samira a small measure of relief.

I could not have accomplished what I've done on my own; and I find it fitting that as we transition away from a militant state and towards a true Sultanate, that I endeavor to make sure I do not shoulder the burden of rulership alone.\n\nIt is with no small amount of reflection and  consideration that I renounce the oath of celibacy that the Hashm Koltāliba traditionally take. The circumstances of rulership demand of me that I do this for the reason that all monarchs must: the burden of governing cannot be shouldered by a single creature, even the most determined of autocrats.

She was meant to arrange for a set of foreign dignitaries to visit in the morning, which she had done; but afterwards, accompanied by Mehmet and some select other members of the Manedalusian Army, they continued to entertain the guests to the Golden Coast by showing them around Coltoba and the nearby beaches. This was a task that would've best been left to civil servants, not to mention one that Samira was not fond of anyway. Having wasted her day in pointless tribulations, it dawned on her, not without a dash of dread, that the reason she indulged this silly endeavor was merely as an excuse. What she had truly wanted was more time to spend with him.\n\nSamira's mind had been abuzz for many weeks now. Having a knack for caligraphy, and being haunted by what she could only describe as contradictory voices, she felt that perhaps the best way to resolve this was with a literal dialogue in page - a diary, of sorts.\n\nThe thought made her groan. All by her lonesome in her office, she sighed in frustration and eyed an empty page and the beckoning quill. These two voices, that shouted over one another like bickering fillies, were her head and her heart. Whenever she attempted to vocalize one, the other would swoop in, yelling over her words until she could no longer hear them nor understand her own thoughts. She thought that maybe, the order and precision of writing could give her the serenity she needed to turns these shouts into meaningful sequences. All conflicts can be understood as a dialectic between two opposing points - if Samira were to set restrictions to their reach, a clear method of engagement, then she was certain they would come, through their fight, to a meaningful conclusion.\n\nShe picked up the quill, and stroked the edge of the page with ink in antecipation."

I'm overwhelmed with a warmth I find hard to describe, and every fiber of my being is distended beyond my ability to bear.\nHead: This is the inevitable consequence of your passions. Whenever you find yourself in control, these are the woes into which you lead us both. Even as you confess your follies, you cherish them still; what hope can I have in your rehabilitation if you refuse to listen to Reason?\nHeart: Are my whims so ridiculous as to deserve your mockery? They were bestowed upon me by Nature, of which Ash-Shahid, in His infinite wisdom, is the sole binding arbiter. I would not have received them were they not meant to serve a constructive purpose. One must deny those desires that are uncouth, destructive, selfish and vicious. But is this passion a foul one, when all it does is make me crave closeness to the one I most cherish?\nHead: You are the most incorrigible of beings who sin! I would remind you of the follies you've debased yourself with, in hopes that I could distill from them some lesson for you, and yet you sallivate over the recollection, you trace the whole sequence with a craving fire that shows you wish nothing but the opportunity to act it over again! I often told you during the course that you were engaging your affections in a manner which would inevitably cause you pain; that the stallion for whom you held them was indeed of the greatest merit, one of good sense, good humor, stainless honor, an honest heart and manner which is displayed in all he does. And yet you are bound to the Order - it is your duty to abstain from these earthly things, for these pleasures were not meant for someone of your stature, for they would stain you and bind you to the world in a manner which the Koltāliba must at all costs avoid. Whenever you are apart from him, you hurt as if you'd find death a lesser punishment. You'd dare ask of me to contrive ingenious excuses to avoid our responsibilities, just so you can further indulge in his presence. You've allowed yourself to become enamored in a line of work where such things result in tragedy with mathematical certainty! He is a military officer, and so are you. Were he to die in the line of duty, what would become of you?\nHeart: As it stands, I believe that his absence would rip me apart. I feel as if his loss would tear my soul asunder, and compel me to a grief of which I may never fully recover.\nHead: Exactly; and you'd cry and sulk in solitude, and all the while you'd leave both the Koltāliba and all of Al-Manedalus without proper leadership, you'd have our entire State, its constituent people, laid bare to danger to indulge your whims! You should have learned long ago that the only way to assure the distance of pain is to retire within ourselves, to suffice for our own happiness. Ours is a world of calculations, and in such a world, both friendship and love are other names for foolish alliances to the follies and misfortunes of others. Why must you continue to torture us both with your fleeting and random whims?\"\n\nThe Grandmistress stopped the stroke of the quill, getting lost in the words. On the verge of tears with her hoof shaking, she searched for a reply, and found little. Speaking strictly from the heart, she steeled herself, took a deep breath, and let the words flow freely:"

  manedalusia.156.d:0 "\"My Heart responds in no uncertain terms: You speak as if your own position does not blind you. Respect for that which belongs to me compels me to remind you of your own limitations, now that you carelessly overstep them to admonish me for performing the duties which were bestowed upon me. When Nature assigned to us the same body to inhabit, it did not make neither me nor you a servant of the other. We were made Co-Emperors, and made to rule together over an empire divided. To you was bestowed the realm of Reason, to me that of morals. This was so because the All-Witnessing, in His infinite wisdom, understood morality to be far too precious and essential a component of our being to be subject to your ever churning machinations of logic and calculation. When a circle must be squared, the weight supported by an arch calculated, the trajectory of a comet traced over the celestial sphere, that is to be your perogative; Nature gave me no knowledge of these things, and I do not envy you for possessing them. Yet you clearly envy my possession of sentiment, as you continually attempt to usurp me from a position whose exercise you nothing of! Our diarchy is quintessential to the spiritual and bodily health of our being; if you ever dare dispose of me, and rule over this Empire on your own, you will find yourself vastly unfit for this task.\nWhat would have become of our country were it left in the hooves of the likes of you? We would have remained a subjugated people, the habitants of Coltoba too paralyzed by risk aversion and calculating precision to do what had to be done. But Armil, Crimson and the others were guided to their action not by their heads, but by their hearts: they threw themselves into hazard, when the hazard seemed against them, for what they knew to be right, knowing well that Divine Providence would reward their adherence to honor and to virtue with success. You would have begun to calculate wealth and numbers; we pumped warm pulsating blood into the veins, we supplied enthusiasm and power against wealth and numbers, and it was by our fortitude, not yours, that Al-Manedalus gained its freedom.\nYou claim that my affections are random, when they are anything but. I did not, nor would I ever, bestow them upon some creature that I did not find worthy, which you have conceded. If others' sorrows are to be my own, then so be it! We were created for each others' mutual benefit, and so it follows that the sorrow of those who we love must be our own. Accept this, and fulfill the roles which Nature rightfully bestowed you, and leave the calculations of the Heart to me. It is by passion, by the heart, that strength is supplied to the nation, not by your calculations whose utilitarian function is complimentary, not a replacement to our own. Mehmet has all the qualities of someone whose sorrow deserves to be my own, and I'd gladly share of both it and his happiness until the end of our days. These are things you know nothing about - so leave it to me to calculate these matters, and I'll call upon you whenever these circumstances call for the pragmatical science of which you are the master.\"\n\nSamira let go of the quill, which rolled over the desk and came to a halt by the edge. Staring at the written words with a tear running down her face, she smiled and chuckled at the absurdity of her endeavor. It was hard to even grasp: she was in love! Her whole life had been dedicated to the denial of earthly things, but circumstances had changed. The Koltāliba were no longer the secretive and reclusive protectors of Coltoba, but its front facing leaders - and if Samira was to remain in control of both, the exercise of love would be as needed as the exercise of reason."

  manedalusia.157.d:0 "With something of a concerned look, the Grandmistress ordered the central courtyard cleared, and bystanders huddled together under the shadows of the building, behind the pillars of the hallway, while still catching a clear view of the battlegrounds. Mehmet was surrounded by tens of eyes that observed his every move, and the feeling made him gulp and clear his throat. Zahid seemed unphased; he removed his robe and hood, revealing his mildly scarred face, and the cut that ran over his split lip and down to his chin. A pair of swords were given by Samira, who said with stoic resolve: \"This fight takes place on hollowed ground. It is to end at first blood, and not a second thereafter. Understood?\"\n\nFor a second, all of Mehmet's life flashed before his eyes. What was he thinking?! Zahid raised the blade, and waited for confirmation. Mehmet, for his part, braced himself while holding the sword close to his center, antecipating a quick strike. When Samira gave the final shout and the duel began, the whole world seemed be frozen into a static image. Mehmet took a deep breath and steadied his hooves. It wouldn't take much longer than that instant for Zahid's blade to swipe."

  manedalusia.158.d:0 "Mehmet closed his eyes, and voiced a silent prayer to Ash-Shahid in the palace of his mind. When the blade came, he was ready for it; he parried the strike, though not without difficulty. The violent slashing of steel against steel ringed right next of his ear, but he endured past it, and swung Zahid back, almost knocking him out of balance.\n\nThe zebra eyed Mehmet with a mixture of rage and shock, but soon regained his composure. Like a viper, the spymaster remained motionless, barely letting his own breathing show, and then lunged forward in a swift strike that continued to make Mehmet jump back in instinct. But each time, Mehmet parried the strike, kept his distance, and Zahid was forced to circle around him, to attempt to find an angle of attack.\nA passing wind could be heard over the courtyard, and the silence was only broken by the swords' shrieks. Perfect strikes soon gave way to violent thrashed from side to side, blind charges against him that he could easily avoid. It took time to wear the spymaster down, but with each blow, Mehmet syphoned a bit of his strength. A nervous sweat dripped over his brow, and his mane fell in front of his eyes. Still, Mehmet preservered, until the right moment made itself apparent; and when it came, he did not hesitate.\n\nMehmet's single offensive strike during the fight barely registered at first. Zahid swiped with a loud grunt from right to left, and Mehmet curved the swordtip's path ever so gently up, until the zebra had been overstretched; then the swipe. Zahid pulled back, and for a second he seemed to barely have even noticed, until he sensed blood dripping from his hoof. Samira seemed equally as surprised, and immediately raised her own, commanding the duel's end.\n\nFrom the shadows came a mixture of soft laughter and a genuine praise. Some of the Koltāliba's numbers found Zahid's defeat to be less a sign of Mehmet's skill and more Zahid's weakness, but some others seemed at least mildly impressed. A round of contained applause snapped Mehmet back to reality, and he laid his sword low, bowing in respect. \"It was quite a fight, sir. But I hope you've learned your lesson and do not try to besmirch the good name of the Manedalusian Army ever again.\"\n\nZahid glared through the officer with murderous eyes, but Mehmet took a deep breath and walk away, hoping to have made his point quite clear. However, as soon as his back was turned, Zahid springed forward."

The Grandmistress, furious, stepped in front of Mehmet, whispering to him: \"At ease, Major. Do not taint your victory.\"\n\nWhen Zahid jumped back on his hooves, he was met with Samira's gaze. \"So, this is how my best spymaster acts in defeat? What an utter disgrace. You dare invoke our traditions and our honor? Even without being in the Order, it seems some ponies in the Army have more of the mettle and honor of a Koltāliba than you. Consider yourself dismissed.\"\n\nThe display was enough to disperse the rallied members back into the temple halls, but Zahid lingered to eye down Mehmet before slinking into the shadows and disappearing. The Grandmistress looked at the major somewhat puzzled - not amused, but at the very least impressed. \"What compelled you to take up his offer?\"\n\nMehmet shrugged his shoulder. \"I'm not sure. I suppose I simply felt the need to defend my good image.\" He chuckled. \"Perhaps you ought to train your subordinates better.\"\n\n\"Maybe. Hmm...\", Samira pondered, then smiled. \"It seems you have what it takes and then some to train a novice. Say, when you review the candidates for further instruction, why don't you take the liberty of introducing them to our facilities?\""

He will preside over the cerimony as requested and take on the title of Grand Vizier.\"\n\n\"And as for that of Sultan?\"\n\n\"The matter may be left as vague as required. The Grandmistress may remain as acting Sultana.\"\n\nZahid looked over the schematics for the Neighdinat Al-Zahra's renovations. With a fitting figurehead secured, it was finally time to undo the damage caused to the Order and retreat once more from public view. The Koltāliba would continue to protect Manedalusia from the shadows, as they were always meant to."

  manedalusia.161.d:0 "In the solitude of the temple, late at night, Samira reflected upon the last few years and the day she was forced by the cruelty of Fate to step forward and lead Manedalusia. She should feel content; after all their efforts, they had defied the odds and made Manedalusia's sovereignty unquestionable to all in Western Zebrica. Its enemies had been laid low and humiliated, its cities grown to be wealthy and prosperous, its people secure and happy. The Koltāliba had achieved everything that would ever have been demanded of them, and then some.\n\nStill, her mind was filled with doubt she could not shake. She wondered how things would've turned out had the madgriff not forced her to take on this role. Was this simply how things were always meant to be?\n\nAs was typical of the ash-shuhūd when the mind wandered to dark places, she turned to the Book of Revelation for comfort, but found little to soothe her worries. She wondered, most of all, if all her decisions had been the right ones - and most pressingly, whether her decision to keep the Koltāliba hidden in the shadows was made out of principle, or out of cowardice.\n\nEither way, with the Sultanate restored and Manedalusia triumphant, it was a choice she'd have to live with."

  manedalusia.162.d:0 "Having been granted a rare moment of respite in solitude in the throne room of the Neighdinat Al-Zahra, Samira sat alone and sighed in relief. After all the trials and tribulations, she had achieved the impossible - Manedalusia was no longer a backwater possession of a foreign realm, but a shining star in Western Zebrica, a modern, industrialized nation with a powerful army, respected abroad, and whose people were secure in their ways and their future. She had turned bad fortune around, and given to Al-Manedalus the happy ending its ponies and zebras deserved, and in the process, established a new dominion that'd keep them safe for generations to come. Despite the utter blow that Manedalusia suffered after gaining its independence, all had turned out for the better.\n\nSamira felt content, at the very least. She was now Sultana and Grandmistress in equal measure, and the meritocratic nature of the future Grandmaster's selection made the line of succession clean and assured. Ash-Shahind willing, the new millenium would provide to Manedalusia the peace and prosperity its people deserved, and Samira would be the first of a long line of Koltāliba Sultans who ruled fairly and efficiently. The legacy of the City of Sunlight had been saved.\n\nSamira felt at peace. The only thing that still haunted the farthest reaches of her mind was the perpetual wondering of what could've been, had she never been shouldered with this burden."

  manedalusia.163.d:0 "Mehmet excitedly made his way past the labyrinthian halls of the Koltāliba temple, and when he finally saw his soon to be wife, he had his breath taken away. For a month or so, she had begun to grow out her mane, and now combed perfectly and adorned with a simple crown around her forehead, bearing a shining emerald, Samira's sight made him speechless.\n\n\"Why are you here?\", she said with a grin. \"I thought I'd meet you by the Qadi's office, before we made our way to the Mufti.\"\n\n\"We did, but I just couldn't resist the chance to give you something first.\" Mehmet held out his hoof and gave Samira a delicate orange and yellow flower. \"It's a pomegranate blossom from my folks' farm. When they married, my father gave one to my mother for the cerimony. And it'd be improper of me not to insist on the tradition.\"\n\nSamira smiled sweetly and let Mehmet tie the blossom to a flock of her mane by her ear, and then kissed him. \"Shall we, then?\"\n\nMany of Coltoba's citizens would gather near the temple steps to watch their new Sultana emerge once the cerimony had concluded, and Samira was greeted to a round of cheers which accompanied the disciplined march of her Koltāliba escort. It had taken no small amount of effort and risk, but years after having achieved its independence, Manedalusia had properly restored its Sultanate, and Coltoba's light could be said to shine as it did so long ago."

Staring wide-eyed past Samira, he replied: \"I don't understand. You'd renounce your oath for...?\"\n\n\"Yes.\", she cut him off and sighed. \"I am not a sentimentalist mare. I've never had to develop the skill to talk openly about my feelings, but... Mehmet, these last few years have been nightmarish. Ever since Armil. Crimson and the others died that I've perpetually been at my wit's end! It's... it's too much. I'm a fighter, not a statesmare. The only light that's held me firm throughout, the only thing that's kept me sane in the midst of this madness... is you.\"\n\nSamira got close enough to Mehmet to grab hold of his hoof. \"I meant what I said in the announcement, Mehmet. I need a Sultan by my side. And it would be the greatest honor of my life if it could be you.\"\n\nMehmet lowered himself in a faux bow before kissing Samira's hoof, and then pulled her closer for an embrace. \"The honor would be all mine.

She had awaken in a weakened state, complaining of aches all over her body and a dizzyness she could not shake off. Fearing the worst, Mehmet felt like every second of waiting took an eternity. When the physicians finally came out of the royal chambers, Mehmet rushed towards them. \"So?! How is she?\"\n\nNot saying a word, the two older ponies held a slight grin on their faces as they moved out of the way for their Sultana. Samira seemed a little better off, but Mehmet felt his heart sink when he saw tears forming in the corners of her eyes and an anxious smile on her lips. In a sudden leap, she wrapped her hooves around him and buried her head in his neck.\n\n\"Samira! What is it?!\"\n\nSilence.

  manedalusia.166.d:0 "\"What is it that holds together the integrity of a State? To despots, the answer is the army, and in the strictest terms they are not mistaken. But the Army's strength is itself drawn from recruits, from capable leadership, and ultimately from the capability of the populace to fight. To the merchant classes, it's the economic power and taxation that holds together a State. Though this too is an undeniably crucial aspect of any administrative state, taxation and budgeting are also subject to the whims of circumstances and the necessity of the moment, to what projects are urgent and what things must be accomplished. To bureaucrats, the administration itself is the foundational pillar; but as any ruler can attest, the loyalty of the bureaucracy is always fickle, and its effectiveness as flexible as the extent of their reach.\n\nWhat I believe to be the core of a State's foundation is love. This is an answer that most kings, presidents, councillors, chancellors, and all other manner of those tasked with heading a state find absurd, as their office demands of them much higher minded concerns that may distract from this crucial yet mundane thing. The State is an extension of the people over which it rules, and said people may either be immoral opportunitists, whose only fitting government is that of a militant despotism, or they may be responsible and prudent, an enobling state that allows all creatures the full extent of political flexibility that depends on that solid foundation. When a people have love flowing through them, when they are united as one, possessing a unified soul that transcends each, the State prospers, as it may draw from a people willing and able to sacrifice what they must, be it in sinew and flesh or in wealth and labor, to protect what belongs to them. It is for this reason that no successful state worthy of the histories has ruled over a barbaric and vicious people - these qualities degrade the Asabiyyah, and in turn, weaken the State.\n\nThis is, thus, the only fitting and universally applicable advice to all rulers that can be given, regardless of the circumstances of their country. Above all, the ruler must foster love - it must flow through them, and back out into the hearts of the citizenry, as it is this love that's at the core of the force of arms that provides the State's tangible power. As all things were made to be dependent on each other, no ruler can ever afford to fall under the false notion that an amicable relation between the people is optional. Cold calculation is corrosive to the warmth of social existence, and love, which enobles a creature by uniting their spirit to that of the whole, provides the stability and strength on which all states are founded. In the midst of terror, of urgent duty or imminent disaster, remember always to exercise the virtue of love, and you will find that together, any challenge can be overcome.\n\n- Armil Khaldun\""

The Koltāliba liked to take things slowly, to measure their words and reflect upon their actions in quiet solitude. This was a privilege she no longer had: Manedalusia remained a tiny, weak state, with its rightful territory partitioned and both Maregypt and Abyssinia surely waiting for an opportunity to pounce upon Coltoba and snuff it out for good.\n\n\"What is the state of the militia?\", she asked.\n\n\"They're enthusiastic, if nothing else!\", replied Mehmet. \"Ever since you finally killed the griffon and seized the fleet that their hopes have been high.

We require more bolstered forces, a proper arsenal, and without the Council, a new chain of command.\"\n\nSamira eyed the map of Coltoba and its surrounded territory, the sparse countryside under her direct purview, and sighed. \"Do not despair\", said Mehmet. \"After every risk we've taken in this endeavor, we are too far gone to give in to defeatism now.

And after having been satisfied with her performance, and having little in the way of peers present, she managed to convince the artillery officer to be her sparring partner.\n\n\"Worry not, Major, I'll go easy on you.\" she said while circling the sparring ring. \"but don't take that as an invitation not to do your best.\"\n\nMehmet war momentarily paralyzed by fear. Samira was slightly shoter than him, and save for the deadly ember in her eyes, seemed rather unthreatening. Then again, that was the general preference of the Koltāliba, who rarely if ever found it fitting to show off their martial skill. Mehmet knew that Samira could move faster than his eye could register if she wanted to, and in the dreadful silence that settled in the empty hall after their spar started, he felt like even agreeing to this was agreeing to his inevitable humiliation. Still, he calmed himself and kept his eyes on the mare, hoping that when she striked, he could make the most of it."

So, Mehmet buried his hooves and waited, barely blinking until Samira moved slightly out of balance. When she did, he sensed a strike incoming, and rather than attempt to block it, he allowed Samira to overextend her hoof on the charge until he could grab hold of it, spin and throw her off of her balance. After he did, and she got right back up, she seemed both surprised and impressed.\n\n\"...maybe I underestimated you a bit, Mehmet.\", she said with a grin. \"Were you always a fighter?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say that\", he replied smugly. \"I suppose I picked up on some things from watching you lot in the temple courtyard. So?\" He held out a hoof and beckoned another strike.\n\nMehmet found working up a sweat in a hoof to hoof spar to be a fun change of pace, compared to usual army duties. Still, Samira clearly gave him more slack than she would have ever given a real foe, and he was not blind to that.

Samira shifted her weight back and forth on her limbs, and Mehmet paid attention to every minutia of her movement: the careful springing of her hind legs, the sharp and sudden motions of her neck, the ever burning softly lit luminescence in her jade eyes...\n\nGetting distracted would be the end of him this time.

Having had some further time to train against other members of the Koltāliba, he felt a little confident; still, when he made his way to the temple, he found that Samira was in possession of a pretty grim resolve. \"I hope you're not too sure of yourself, Major. I did promise I wouldn't go easy on you this time.\"\n\nMehmet readied himself as soon as he stepped into sunlight of the courtyard. Samira shifted her weight back and forth on her limbs, and Mehmet paid attention to every minutia of her movement: the careful springing of her hind legs, the sharp and sudden motions of her neck, the ever burning softly lit luminescence in her jade eyes...\n\nGetting distracted would be the end of him this time. There was no room for hesitation, or even ambiguity in what he must do. If the Grandmistress sensed even the slightest improper motion, he knew she could exploit it. Without any room for error, Mehmet would only have one opportunity to take Samira down, before she inevitably cracked him through attrition.\n\nLike a thrown lightning, Samira sprinted toward him."
  manedalusia.171.a:0 "Despite his best efforts, Mehmet could not quite match the Grandmistress."
  manedalusia.171.b:0 "§CHold your ground, protect your center, and wait for the time to strike.§!"
  manedalusia.172.t:0 "The Final Showdown"
  manedalusia.172.d:0 "Mehmet stood his ground and waited for Samira to commit fully to her charge. He knew how the Koltāliba fought - they put their whole weight behind their strikes, throwing the enemy off their balance before going in for the final blow. Mehmet had no chance of beating Samira on her own terms, but he did have something she lacked, and as she'd find out, the cunning to make use of that advantage.\n\nSamira nearly came into contact with the Major, hoping to immediately knock him down, but just before she could reach him, Mehmet flapped his wings and lunged to the side, letting the Grandmistress swoop past him without allowing her a chance to touch him. This immediately threw Samira off of her game, and she seemed caught off guard as she came to a sudden stop, burying her hooves into the ground. Mehmet took the opportunity to grab hold of her before she could turn around, taking momentary flight, and then letting go of the zebra when he lost hold of her weight, letting her fall to the ground, where Mehmet pinned her.\n\nWhen the ecstasy and adrenaline of the moment faded, the Major found himself holding down a shellshocked and utterly surprised Samira, who eyed him with a mixture of some emotions he could not quite describe. Eventually, he cut through the tension with a chuckle. \"I think it was you who was too confident, in the end.\"\n\nBefore the Grandmistress' surprised turned to frustration and she broke free, Mehmet simply let her go and extended a hoof to help her back up. Hiding a hint of blush from sheer embarrassment, she turned her eyed. \"I... I think I did underestimate you severely. By the grace of Ash-Shahid, how shameful of me! I suppose I didn't think I could be laid low while fighting at my best against a pony from the Manedalusian Army.\"\n\n\"I might have taken offense to that!\", Mehmet laughed. \"But I'm just glad I could prove we're not a bunch of slouches either.\"\n\n The thought brought Samira a small measure of comfort. Ever since the Koltāliba had been forced to step forward into governance that she had feared, in the back of her mind, that the burden of leadership fell solely on her shoulders. Having some assurance that she had capable ponies to rely on, Samira smiled."
  manedalusia.172.a:0 "\"We should do this more often.\""
  manedalusia.173.t:0 "The Way Of The Serpent"
  manedalusia.173.d:0 "Mehmet eyed the beast with a sharp glance, and it eventually reletend and ceased its constant hissing. \"Hey, look at that!\", Al-Neighzari laughed. \"Seems he's growing to like you a bit!\"\n\n\"Is Xerxes always this aggressive?\", Mehmet questioned the engineer while he worked on his hinge mechanism.\n\n\"Oh, for sure! There's hardly a creature he seems to get along with.\" While tightening the frame's bolts with a wrench, Al-Neihari scratched his chin and gave a sideways glance. \"Huh. You know, Samira seems to be the one other creature Xerxes respects. Oh! Perhaps he can sense for great warriors! What do you think?\"\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous.\", Mehmet scoffed.\n\n\"Oh, but I'm being serious! Hmmm...\" Al-Neighari smiled. \"Say, the Grandmistress seems to trust you a great deal. I reckon that as things stand, you're just about the one pony she can tolerate in the Army. Why do you think she dislikes me so?\"\n\n\"Well, Al-Neighari, don't take it the wrong way, but I think for most army ponies, your... attitude is a little too much to deal with.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand. I was never made of army mettle anyway.\" The engineer put down his wrench and came to the Major's side, holding out his hoof towards Xerxes. \"I will tell you this, though: hanging around the Koltāliba is sort of like hanging out around snakes. They're a hardy, calculating bunch. And you seem to handle yourself well among them. Maybe that means you're more in touch with your animal side than you realize.\"\n\nWhen the serpent wrapped itself around Al-Neighari's hoof and crawled up to his shoulders, the engineer held it out again and beckoned the Major. somewhat reluctantly, Mehmet allowed Xerxes to make its way out of its owners' back and onto his extended limb, and fighting through the fear, he let the serpent slowly make its way next to its head, where it settled into a passive state and hissed softly by his ear.\n\nWith a whistle and a small nudge, Xerxes came off of him with barely a complaint out of the little beast, and Mehmet felt a bit more confident in himself thereafter."
  manedalusia.173.a:0 "\"See? He likes you!\""
  manedalusia.174.t:0 "Clarity Of Mind"
  manedalusia.174.d:0 "Mehmet began to regret the journey about halfway through, but by then it was far too late to back down. Traveling the desert in the cool of night was much more bearable than doing in it in the blistering day, but the Kom Marebo was just as hostile at night, in its own way. A freezing breeze blew over the distant dunes, and under his hooves, the cracked soil offered little in the way of comfort with each step. Outside of the sparse villages and the spread out beaten paths, the open desert always proved to be a poor companion.\n\nMehmet grew up on the coast, a short strut away from the ocean's view. The desert had long intrigued him as a mystical place, and most importantly, one where the distance from others provided at least some passing tranquility.\n\nThe Major saw a scorpion burying itself beneath the sand and dust. In the distance, a lone hardy shrub hung by a wind blown ridge. The soft flaps of a bird's wing reached his ear. Mehmet found it fascinating how even in this wasteland, life found a way to thrive, on its own terms.\n\nIn the quietness of solitude, Mehmet found some peace. The army was a strict place, and though he thrived in it, the lack of constant noise, pressure and busywork gave him the freedom to reflect.\n\nTime melted to a standstill out in the desert. Mehmet understood why mystics and wise ponies found it a fitting place to become one with the mind of Ash-Shahid, away from the distractions of mundane things. When the burdens of daily existence seemed distant, the desert made all things seem clear."
  manedalusia.174.a:0 "Nothing is more frightening in an opponent than a clear mind."
  manedalusia.175.t:0 "On The Brevity Of Life"
  manedalusia.175.d:0 "As part of Manedalusian efforts to bring the newly conquered lands of Maregypt under their purview, Samira arranged for a population census and a cross-country tour, in order to meet with local administrators in Manephis. As the Grandmistress and her escort made their way down the Neighle Valley, they came under the shadows of the massive pyramids which stood as a monument to the nation's history and culture. The sight of those massive things, which towered over the horizon on either side of the valley, caught Samira's eye, and Mehmet took notice. \"Is something wrong, Grandmistress?\"\n\n\"The pyramids got me wondering about... life, I suppose. The Maregyptians constructed these things to honor their esteemed dead. Have you ever read the works of Al-Muhd?\"\n\n\"No. The name does ring a bell, though.\"\n\n\"A scholar from the First Age of Humility. He famously said that our life is brief, and our art is long. I must confess that even I often wonder about how short our spell of life seems to be. Don't you?\"\n\nMehmet pondered for an instant. Being an army officer, he did often wonder about his own mortality, even if he did not particularly feel as if his life was in much danger. Still, after giving it a second of thought he said:"
  manedalusia.175.a:0 "Ash-Shahid simply deemed it was to be so."
  manedalusia.175.b:0 "It is not that life is short. Rather, much of it is wasted."
  manedalusia.175.c:0 "Life is something of an absurd enigma in its unfairness."
  manedalusia.176.t:0 "On The Brevity Of Life"
  manedalusia.176.d:0 "\"What do you mean?\", Samira prodded.\n\n\"Well...\", Mehmet straightened out his back on the seat. \"Suppose it's something I came to think over the course of my years in the Army. When I was young, the family got into a severe dispute with our neighbors over our farm. It came to me one day: all creatures are so adamant in protecting what belongs to them only when it comes to material things. From Coltoba to the far reaches of Colthage and back, I don't think you'd find a creature, be they cat, pony, zebra or otherwise, who'd willingly allow another to steal their money, their estate or their property. We're all very wary of letting others take our wealth... and yet, how much of our time is wasted in pointless nonsense? I think we were given enough time, at least, to do the most important things, but most creatures spend it poorly. We'd never let another steal so much as a coin from our pocket, but when it comes to time, a precious thing of which we are given a palpably finite supply, most seem to have no care for how they spend it!\"\n\nThe Grandmistress savored Mehmet's words for a moment, before replying with a grin: \"I didn't take you for a philosopher, Major.\"\n\n\"I'm not, really. But I will ask you: do you think we're wasting our time?\"\n\nSamira almost took the question as an insult, but replied in short: \"Of course not.\"\n\nMehmet then offered the Grandmistress a gracious smile."
  manedalusia.176.a:0 "\"Then I assure you, it will be long enough.\""

  MDL_dream_of_a_federation_desc:0 "Manedalusia, Maregypt and Ovingoland shall become the birthing place of a new experiment; an experiment to see if constitutionalism, democracy, and a government conceived above all in defence of liberty can survive and thrive here in Western Zebrica. Fillies and gentlecolts, let us build for ourselves a true Federation to stand tall against all who'd have us made slaves again."
  MDL_liberate_abyssinia:0 "Liberate Abyssinia"
  MDL_liberate_abyssinia_desc:0 "No pony in Coltoba has fond memories of our time under Abyssinian occupation, but in a way, we must thank them; their cruel Basha reminded us that no matter what, our freedom is always worth fighting for. It's only right we return the favor, and bring democracy and freedom all the way to Panthera!"
  MDL_integrate_abyssinia:0 "The Kittens Turn To Lions"
  MDL_integrate_abyssinia_desc:0 "Pony or Cat, all creatures fight at their strongest when they do so in defence of their own liberty. The downtrodden populace of Abyssinia, though spared outright slavery, has suffered greatly under the incompetence of their despots. Under a constitutional government, let's how fierce is their roar."
  MDL_liberate_klugetown:0 "Into the Hive of Scum and Villany"
  MDL_liberate_klugetown_desc:0 "Klugetown's political position cannot be allowed to stand. It's about time we uproot the mafia for good. The populace is used to their independence, but they'd just as easily turn on their cruel rulers if we provide them with sovereignty and stable rule."
  MDL_integrate_klugetown:0 "The Federal District of Klugetown"
  MDL_integrate_klugetown_desc:0 "Klugetown's status as a former Abyssinian town makes it unfeasible to integrate them as a full city-state and member of the Federation. However, given the city's skydocks and how used the populace is to their independence, this issue is simple enough to solve. And we might just get some help with that..."
  MDL_liberate_yemane:0 "Liberate Yemane"
  MDL_liberate_yemane_desc:0 "Us and the Yemaneis are not that different, all things considered. Only two major differences come to mind: for one, we know we stand tall under the protection of His All-Seing Eye. And secondly, we go into battle as brethren in arms, united in comradery and in love for liberty, not to protect some despot's fiefdom."
  MDL_integrate_yemane:0 "The Yemanei Republic"

  MDL_liberate_donkeys_desc:0 "An old poniestale states that many centuries ago, when the cruel God-Kings of Assur harrassed the faithful in pilgrimage to Mareakech, Ash-Shahid sent lightning from the Heavens to bring down the city walls.

  MDL_integrate_donkeys:0 "Bring the Donkeys Into the Fold"
  MDL_integrate_donkeys_desc:0 "Among the peoples of Western Zebrica, it's the donkeys that are most used to being trampled upon by uncaring despots.

  MDL_liberate_purrsia:0 "Liberate Purrsia"
  MDL_liberate_purrsia_desc:0 "It's ironic, truly, to have Manedalusian arms fighting side by side with the catfolk of Abyssinia in this manner. But Fate is a funny thing, and all our grudges aside, every creature on these shores knows that Wingbardian colonialism must be repelled before it further entrenches.

  MDL_purchase_land_maregypt_desc:0 "If the Maregyptian government can be reasoned with, then we can make peace between our nations and arrange for a formal purchase of our rightful lands.

  MDL_industrial_development_program:0 "Industrial Development Program"

  MDL_ask_HIP_for_help_desc:0 "In the shores of Zebrica, Harmony's greatest historical representative is the royal government of Mount Aris, and with Equestria fallen to the Djinn, they are now arguably its greatest remaining bulwark.

  MDL_sweet_ass_rides:0 "Manedalusia Motors"
  MDL_sweet_ass_rides_desc:0 "Motorizing the army will go a long way to improving its effectiveness, even if we limit this to support companies and minor units.

  MDL_better_guns:0 "Ditch the Antiques"
  MDL_better_guns_desc:0 "The Hashm Koltāliba may be very traditionalist in their views, but when it comes to matters of warfare, they're always at the forefront of innovation.

For these dauntless few, we will establish the Manedalusian Ranger Corps, a body of elite soldiers that will provide crucial support to our mainline forces with their expertise."
  MDL_samira_as_general:0 "General Samira"
  MDL_samira_as_general_desc:0 "The Grandmistress has grown tired of silently honing her trade in the Order's reclusive halls, and is willing to join the Manedalusian military proper. Nopony seriously doubts her capabilities, so we'll make sure to streamline her aptitude tests to quickly officialize her entry into the general staff."
  MDL_modern_army_crash_course:0 "Modern Tactics Crash Course"
  MDL_modern_army_crash_course_desc:0 "Our military command largely picked up their skills on the job, being trained by necessity in minor border skirmishes and drilling under the Abyssinian administration. Their formal education in military matters is relatively lackluster, and now that we have the resources to change this, we should arrange a condensed course on modern military doctrine for our general staff."
  MDL_koltaliba_commissars:0 "The Koltāliba Commissariat"
  MDL_koltaliba_commissars_desc:0 "Now that preparations have been finalized, we are ready to reintegrate the Hashm Koltāliba into the army in its traditional form. A member of the Order will be assigned to individual units to provide advice to its commander, and make sure the soldiers aren't slacking off in their training."
  MDL_special_forces_regimentation:0 "Special Forces Regimentation"
  MDL_special_forces_regimentation_desc:0 "While the Koltāliba are deadly warriors, what makes them most distinct from the common soldier is their strict conditioning. Initiates in their Order are expected to be able to survive with minimal food and water for several days and complete their given tasks before they're even granted full status as a member. This kind of conditioning will do our special forces much good."
  MDL_desert_drift:0 "Magical Engines"
  MDL_desert_drift_desc:0 "An ongoing issue with our vehicles has been their heavy cost of maintenance in rough desert terrain. Al-Neighari believes he can fix this issue with a clever application of Magitek. We'll provide him the funding he needs to get this done."
  MDL_fast_shell_reloading:0  "Magical Autoloaders"
  MDL_fast_shell_reloading_desc:0 "Reloading artillery shells is a delicate multi stage process that requires a dedicated crew. However, Al-Neighzari claims to be able to bypass much of the hassle with a clever application of magic. If he succeeds, our artillery pieces will have a greatly increased rate of fire. Let's see if he can deliver."
  MDL_military_industrial_council:0 "A Military Industrial Council"
  MDL_military_industrial_council_desc:0 "Cooperating with private industry can be difficult during peacetime, especially when the nation needs to quickly be put on a war footing. Military high command proposed the creation of the Majlis Tanmiyat as-Sinā'a Al-Askarīya, an advisory body with industry representatives that would allow us to more efficiently coordinate wartime production."
  MDL_citizen_guard:0 "Form the Haras Al-Muwātin"
  MDL_citizen_guard_desc:0 "While law enforcement is simple enough in Coltoba and other cities, we have a vast countryside that also needs policing, which our armed forces can't do effectively. The Haras Al-Muwātin will be a body of rural law enforcement, drawn from locals with no criminal record and providing generous pay. Not only will this make law enforcement effective outside our urban centers, it will free up able bodied ponies from garrison duty for more pressing services."
  MDL_alchemical_investment:0 "Fund Alchemical Development"
  MDL_alchemical_investment_desc:0 "Moonstriker's personal laboratory has already produced promising prototypes for magical technology, as well as new techniques for synthetic magic crystal production. With this in mind, it's only right we endeavor to turn this passion project into a fully industrial development for the Manedalusian army."
  MDL_protect_the_skies:0 "Guard The Manedalusian Skies"
  MDL_protect_the_skies_desc:0 "Should Manedalusia ever be under attack, we must be capable of defending our aerial space against enemy air forces if we wish to preserve our home advantage. As such, we shall establish a network of Anti-Air batteries to protect the coast of Al-Manedalus from any encroaching threat."
  MDL_grand_army_of_al_manedalus:0 "The Grand Army of Al-Manedalus"
  MDL_grand_army_of_al_manedalus_desc:0 "From a rebellious garrison backed by disorganized militia forces, we have built an army whose discipline and devotion can match the most revered professional armies in the world. We can now fully commit to a modern military doctrine, and further perfect our craft such that Manedalusian forces will be known far and wide."
###NAVY TREE###
  MDL_navy_stuff:0 "Fortune Favors the Bold"
  MDL_navy_stuff_desc:0 "Our beloved coast is a fine home, but we're not blind to its harsh, relatively barren soil and lack of innate wealth. Since time immemorial, Manedalusians have known our prosperity relies on our will to seek it out, across the desert and the sea. With our homeland reunified, the time has come to set sail in search of our fortune once more."
  MDL_expand_markets:0 "Open Our Markets"
  MDL_expand_markets_desc:0 "During the Golden Age of Sailing, Manedalusian cities gathered wealth and artifacts from all across Western Zebrica and beyond. Even to this day, the Coltoba harbor has a large marketplace that's largely fallen to disuse. We'll refurbish the old stalls and sponsor the local industry, as the first step to restoring our coast as a major trade node."
  MDL_expand_harbors:0 "Expand our Harbors"
  MDL_expand_harbors_desc:0 "Manedalusia needs a fleet to call its own, and by corollary, it needs extensive dockyards to expand and maintain it. Time is of the essence; we will refurbish and expand existing dockyards, while also building new ones, to service our naval force."
  MDL_restore_merchant_fleet:0 "Restore the Merchant Fleet"
  MDL_restore_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "Arguably Manedalusia's most renowned institution to the wider world, the Merchant Fleet was once an economic force to be reckoned with. Centuries ago, there was not a port city in the coast of Western and Northern Zebrica where one could not find a Manedalusian merchant captain. Our shipyards will be tailored to produce new ships for enterprising crews willing to set sail to foreign ports."
  MDL_fleet_tech:0 "A Modern Fleet"
  MDL_fleet_tech_desc:0 "Manedalusia won't settle for cheap, outdated models for its Navy. When it comes to the strike cruisers and destroyers that make up its bulk, we will be at the forefront of technological innovation."
  MDL_coltoba_shipyards:0 "The Coltoba Shipyards"
  MDL_coltoba_shipyards_desc:0 "As we struggle to build up a fleet worthy of the homeland, other powers already have well established navies sailing the sea. This is not the time for bureaucratic bloat or production inefficiencies. Cooperating with the Mercantile League will give us access to the materials and crews we need to streamline construction of new vessels."
  MDL_golden_coast:0 "The Golden Coast"
  MDL_golden_coast_desc:0 "Despite the relative lack of material wealth inherent to our coast, it is strikingly beautiful. Its beauty, in long bygone eras, was such that it enamored a Colthaginian trader into writing about it in letters. To attract bussiness and visitors to our shore, it seems only natural that we embrace the nickname he so kindly bestowed upon it."
  MDL_grand_zoco:0 "The Grand Sūq"
  MDL_grand_zoco_desc:0 "One of the most innovative economic developments of ancient Manedalusia, the Sūq pulled investment from far and wide towards our nation. Now that our merchant fleet stands strong, we'll re-establish the Sūq in Coltoba, and hope it will entice foreign investors to come spend their money."
  MDL_naval_patrols:0 "Green Bay Naval Patrols"
  MDL_naval_patrols_desc:0 "Stable trade must be backed with force. In ancient times, Manedalusia maintained a flexible navy that patrolled its coast and beyond to protect our merchant vessels from pirates and foreign privateers. By beggining war games and establishing regular patrols in the Green Bay, we'll be investing in our future commercial routes, not to mention providing our captains with some much needed experience out at sea."
  MDL_grand_admiralty:0 "Manedalusian Grand Admiralty"
  MDL_grand_admiralty_desc:0 "Under Abyssinian occupation, the garrison was a strictly land-based force. It's only because of Grifo's timely intervention and help from the Aquileian Jean-Claude that we have naval officers at all. Even in past ages, despite the prevalence of our fleet, the Sultanate lacked a proper admiralty. We will establish this officer corps as its own independent branch of the armed forces."
  MDL_capital_ships:0 "Bases on the Move"
  MDL_capital_ships_desc:0 "Manedalusia always favored fast and nimble vessels, but our fleet used to be commanded from larger galleons which acted as mobile bases for the Sultan's army during campaign. This shall be the role of our capital ships."
  MDL_naval_depot_network:0 "Naval Depot Network"
  MDL_naval_depot_network_desc:0 "A clever technique we traditionally used to coordinate operations across the sea, by cooperating with local private contractors we can establish independent drydocks all over the coast, even outside the effective range of our major shipyards and bases, to refuel, repair and dock our vessels."
  MDL_marine_corps:0 "Coastal Assault Corps"
  MDL_marine_corps_desc:0 "The Hashm Koltāliba's main role in ancient times was to safeguard our merchant marine out at sea. In the modern age, amphibious invasions are some of the most delicate military operations an army can perform. The Order's abilities, combined with an eager special forces recruitment pool, will allow us to fulfill this niche."
  MDL_naval_academy:0 "Madrasat Al-Bahr Al-Manedalusiyyah"
  MDL_naval_academy_desc:0 "A crucial institution for our future officers-in-training, the Manedalusia Naval Academy will allow us to grant an effective education to promising young ponies, and firmly cement our position as a maritime power to be reckoned with."
  MDL_back_in_bussiness:0 "Back In Bussiness"
  MDL_back_in_bussiness_desc:0 "No longer will we be content to scrape together our living in isolation. Coltoba's ponies long to sail the sea in search of their fortunes, and we've ignored our call for far too long. Gather your crews and keep your wits about you, captains! It's time to do good on the mercantile charters."
  MDL_coffee_current:0 "Sail the Coffee Current"
  MDL_coffee_current_desc:0 "From the lush isle of Puerto Caballo to the western coast of Abyssinia runs a lucrative route, one the Wingbardians saw the value of when they seized the Rasdom from the Lion's claws. Manedalusian traders have been sailing those waters for centuries, even during our economic slump. We'll let them know our charters are available, for the right price, and with just that little nudge, the Coffee Current's abundant wealth will stretch out a tendril towards Coltoba."
  MDL_colthaginian_deal:0 "A Deal with Colthage"
  MDL_colthaginian_deal_desc:0 "Our history with Kolt-Hadast is long. We were never the best of friends; amicable partners, in the best of times, fierce competitors in others. But in the modern age, Hippogriffia's strangled their reach past Seaquestria and into the lucrative routes of the Green Bay. But it's not like Colthage has nothing to offer us. So, let's start off the millenium on good terms, by sharing in this wealth - for the right price."
  MDL_reliable_traders:0 "Ponies You Can Rely On"
  MDL_reliable_traders_desc:0 "Manedalusians used to be middleponies to trade across foreign nations because we were reliable; we delivered our goods, we repaid our debts with interest, and we always honored our word. By establishing laws against unfair lending and corruption, we can rebuild this trust. If you want a quick sum of bits, go try your luck in Skyfall; if you want your investment paid back every time, you come to Coltoba."
  MDL_merchant_outposts:0 "Mercantile Outposts"
  MDL_merchant_outposts_desc:0 "Military shipyards and naval bases are hardly an efficient place to service merchant captains. We'll sponsor the establishment of exclusive ports in our cities and abroad where traders can refuel and resupply without straining our naval assets."
  MDL_green_bay_masters:0 "Masters of the Green Bay"
  MDL_green_bay_masters_desc:0 "Just as in ancient times, we've risen to dominate the Green Bay's trade. Even the proudest Zarantian and the most stubborn Colthaginian knows that if you want to do bussiness in these waters, we are your best option. And just like in ancient times, Ash-Shahid repays our efforts with prosperity for the homeland, as not even Tobuck itself can claim as big a share of this bounty."
###AIR TREE###
  MDL_air_stuff:0 "Taking to the Heavens"
  MDL_air_stuff_desc:0 "This new frontier of warfare is one we have no experience in, but it's clearly crucial for the effectiveness of a modern army. Our pegasi shock troops once flew high and struck the enemy from above, and now, it's time to evolve this honorable method of warfare. Let's start simple: we'll finance an air base and start experimenting."
  MDL_air_industry:0 "Aeronautical Industry"
  MDL_air_industry_desc:0 "Unlike our Pegasi soldiers, to whom Nature gifted flight, our pilots don't have the luxury of innate talent. They need wings of metal, and we will provide them in spades."
  MDL_radar:0 "Radar Tech"
  MDL_radar_desc:0 "Having some planes is all well and good, but without coordination, recon and intel, we might as well send our pilots soaring while blindfolded. What we need is to begin setting up our own radar towers, so our aces know where to go and what to do."
  MDL_death_from_above:0 "Death From Above"
  MDL_death_from_above_desc:0 "As fillies and foals, all Manedalusians probably heard the bedtime tale of the Tyrant of Sineighi; a wicked stallion who claimed to speak for Ash-Shahid, and stole undue taxes from the congregation for his own gain. The All and Ever-Witnessing commanded a young mare to fly above him and drop a boulder on his head. It seems we can now replicate the feat, on a wider scale."
  MDL_an_air_doctrine:0 "A Proper Aerial Doctrine"
  MDL_an_air_doctrine_desc:0 "Our experimentation with planes has done our armed forces much good. It's about time we pick a specialization and delineate the role they'll play in battle; no matter what we choose, however, it's clear that they'll make our army into a force to be reckoned with."
  MDL_unstoppable_pilots:0 "Through the Fire and the Flames"
  MDL_unstoppable_pilots_desc:0 "Our aces will be more than experts in their craft. Any nation can produce those; but only we ash-shuhūd can produce warriors of such mental caliber to not fear the most powerful storm."
  MDL_bomber_pilots:0 "Overwhelming Power"
  MDL_bomber_pilots_desc:0 "The main advantage of an air force is its ability to gain air superiority and drop unceasing destructive power upon our enemies with little resistance. So, let's take full advantage of this reality."
  MDL_rocket_research:0 "Rocket Salvos"
  MDL_rocket_research_desc:0 "In yet another innovation towards ever increasing firepower saturation, rocket salvos provide another avenue to deliver devastating payloads at minimal risk to our own soldiers."
  MDL_heavy_air:0 "Sky Fortresses"
  MDL_heavy_air_desc:0 "Be it on land, at sea or high above the clouds, Manedalusians don't like to feel overburdened by their own equipment. We prefer to strike swiftly, to keep the enemies on their hooves and our senses sharp. But preferences aside, it's unwise to get too used to your place of comfort; heavier, bulkier fighter models will allow us to pack a much needed bigger punch."
  MDL_naval_air:0 "A Boon to the Manedalusian Navy"
  MDL_naval_air_desc:0 "Al-Manedalus would be dishonored to lag behind innovation when it comes to the maintenance of a flexible and powerful Navy. And when it comes to innovation at sea, it seems the sky is, quite literally, the limit!"
  MDL_the_bomb:0 "By the Rivers Of Braylon We Sat..."
  MDL_the_bomb_desc:0 "The power of the Atom is a cursed thing. As we begin delving into this cutting edge field of scientific development, we must remember that we are dealing with the very fabric of Creation. May Ash-Shahid guide our hooves, and let this be worth it."
###ULTRAMAR TREE###
  MDL_overseas_dominion:0 "An Overseas Dominion"
  MDL_overseas_dominion_desc:0 "Grifo's leap of faith has been justly rewarded. With the military Council out of the way, we can now begin our holy mission to purify this land and create the bulwark from which we may forge the Universal Imperium."
  MDL_get_some_gear:0 "Some Much Needed Gear"
  MDL_get_some_gear_desc:0 "Grifo's contacts abroad are extensive. An old griff in Feathisia is just the person he needs to get an usable supply of equipment. We will need every last rifle."
  MDL_get_some_muscle:0 "Call For The Muscle"
  MDL_get_some_muscle_desc:0 "Despite everything, Grifo is not entirely alone in the holy cause. Through cunning, he's managed to get further than his fellows, but now that he's staked a usable claim here in Zebrica, it's only right to call upon our few friends. We'll have to stick together in order for this project to succeed."
  MDL_crush_the_koltaliba:0 "Crush The Resistance"
  MDL_crush_the_koltaliba_desc:0 "The Grandmistress of the Koltāliba is the last meaningful node of resistance to our rule over this land. From what little Grifo knows of her, she and her order are all cunning and resourceful zebras to the last. They should be dealt with swiftly."
  MDL_crack_down_on_coltoba:0 "Assert Our Authority"
  MDL_crack_down_on_coltoba_desc:0 "The populace needs to be made to understand that we have little time to waste with formalities. Time waits for no creature, and our time is short indeed! We will make accomodations to begin properly asserting our control of the city, and from there, to the whole of the coast."
  MDL_harbor_fortification:0 "Fortify The Harbor"
  MDL_harbor_fortification_desc:0 "Grifo and his crew have been relegated to 'ruling' over the city from their fleet, with a beachhead in the harbor. Its fortification would not only help to begin properly asserting control on land, it would also serve to protect the Dominion in the near future."
  MDL_clean_loose_ends:0 "§RClean Up The Loose Ends§!"
  MDL_clean_loose_ends_desc:0 "We can ill afford to keep around subversive elements to our cause. Poor foundations make for an unstable State, and ours will be quite fragile as it is."
  MDL_burn_the_courthouse:0 "§RWipe The Slate Clean§!"
  MDL_burn_the_courthouse_desc:0 "All that stands between us and total control over this new dominion is the natives' foolish religion. Given our urgency, a most regretable sacrifice must be made. We will burn down the Qadi's courhouse, to ensure no meaningful archive remains. And if the Qadi wishes to die in defence of his legacy, we will somberly oblige him."
  MDL_lord_of_ultramar:0 "§CEu, Senhor Do Ultramar§!"
  MDL_lord_of_ultramar_desc:0 "Until the rightful Emperor is retrieved from his captivity, it will fall on Grifo to lead this fledgling state. The gods smile upon this land, as the last vestige of the civilizing light still survives through our efforts. May this be the springboard of many glories to come!"

  MDL_restoring_the_light:0 "An Ember In The Darkness"
  MDL_restoring_the_light_desc:0 "Here in the shores of Zebrica, the first of many Dominions stands strong. Though the Eternal City is distant, its light burns within us, and by the will of the Gods, we shall return in triumph to wretch it from the barbarians' claws; and until then, we will make of this land a worthy state."
  MDL_expand_new_karthin_industrial_base:0 "The Forges of New Karthin"
  MDL_expand_new_karthin_industrial_base_desc:0 "In this era of industry, the strength of our hearts, though crucial, is far from sufficient. We need weapons for our soldiers, and the ever churning forges to supply them in droves. We will make arrangements for a modernized industrial district in the city center."
  MDL_colonial_arms_production:0 "Arms Of The Dominion"
  MDL_colonial_arms_production_desc:0 "The garrisons of the Dominion need weapons for their trade with haste! We will cooperate with the newly established Guard and the industrial syndicates to materialize the arm shipments our army requires, and no expense shall be spared for that purpose."
  MDL_colonial_troops:0 "Tropas Coloniais"
  MDL_colonial_troops_desc:0 "To fight is an honorable profession, and no creature will be denied the chance to serve the Dominion for generous pay, be they pony, griffon, cat or whatever else. The Dominion's holy mission unites us in purpose, and the Universal Empire's soldiers shall come from all walks of life."
  MDL_imperial_autarky:0 "Autarquia Imperial"
  MDL_imperial_autarky_desc:0 "Much like every last bone and sinew of the nation must be given to the holy cause, so must every material output of the Dominion's mines, factories, quarries and farms. In this age of war, wasting time on mercantilist endeavors is a preposterous notion."
  MDL_colonial_university:0 "University of New Karthin"
  MDL_colonial_university_desc:0 "The restoration is both material, spiritual, and intellectual in nature. To this end, the faculties of old Coltoba will serve the Dominion well, and from that basis we will build an academic institution the likes of which shall put all of Zebrica to shame."
  MDL_maregypt_infrastructure_expansion:0 "Expand Maregypt's Infrastructure"
  MDL_maregypt_infrastructure_expansion_desc:0 "To solidify our rule over Maregypt and bring it into the Dominion's fold, we will develop the north of the country, to more efficiently ferry garrison troops across the urban centers and further south towards Ovingoland."
  MDL_imperial_shipyards:0 "Birthing The New Imperial Armada"
  MDL_imperial_shipyards_desc:0 "The native Manedalusians pride themselves on their once powerful and flexible merchant navy, and it'd be most unwise to uproot a such perfectly functional tradition. With their help, the Dominion shall bring forth an Armada to match the barbarians' own."
  MDL_griffon_tech:0 "The Knights of Old, Born Anew"
  MDL_griffon_tech_desc:0 "The modernist and the romantic find their synthesis in the new Imperial Knight; this powerful shock troop, armed with the finest weapons of the modern age while still possessing that unassailable spirit of righteous chivalry, will be the vanguard of the Dominion's army."
  MDL_pony_synthesis:0 "Synthesize The Manedalusian Spirit"
  MDL_pony_synthesis_desc:0 "With the catfolk kingdom brought low before us, Grifo has proven the Dominion's strength both to the wider world and to the Manedalusians at the heart of his realm. The slaves come marching home, their oppressors humbled, and all doubts in the ponies' minds will surely melt away."
  MDL_king_of_arabia:0 "El-Rei Dos Árabes"
  MDL_king_of_arabia_desc:0 "From the desert reaches of Maregypt to the tip of the Arabian peninsula, Ultramar stands strong and undivided. \"Et Pluribus, Unum\"; and out of these many, one Dominion is forged, ever loyal to the Universal Empire soon to be born. Be they pony, griffon, horse or otherwise, all know whom the gods favor."
  MDL_colonial_industry:0 "Embrace The Industrial Age"
  MDL_colonial_industry_desc:0 "Our sizeable industrial base is already beggining to shape the Dominion's social life, and we must encourage this process to continue to its fullest extension. New grants and expansion of the syndicates' authority shall further solidify our transition to a fully industrialized economy."
  MDL_imperial_education:0 "Shape The Young Minds"
  MDL_imperial_education_desc:0 "The Dominion's young minds need food for their thought, which we will provide in abundance. A basic curriculum will be enforced across all of the Dominion's territories, and all creatures will be given the practical and abstract skills to do their part in the restoration."
  MDL_core_klugetown:0 "Cleanse the Rot"
  MDL_core_klugetown_desc:0 "This haven of industrial production is corrupted by robber barons and cruel, despotic criminals who provide the citizens no sense of destiny. We thank them; their wickedness has made of Klugetown a blank slate, onto which the Imperium's soul can be imprinted with ease."
  MDL_colonial_administration:0 "Autoridade Colonial do Ultramar"
  MDL_colonial_administration_desc:0 "Ruling over the Dominion's territories will be a troublesome and arduous task, one that requires compromise and pragmatism. A decentralized system of governorates, loyal to New Karthin while still partially elected by the locals, will assure a smoothly run administration."
  MDL_grand_colonial_railway:0 "Grande Ferrovia Colonial"
  MDL_grand_colonial_railway_desc:0 "Stretching from Somnambula to Trotgiers, this marvel of modernity will bring together all of the Dominion's creatures. The Grand Colonial Railway will both fully connect the far flung reaches of the Overseas, and project the strength of our united spirit."
  MDL_pony_imperials:0 "Manedalusian Collaboration"
  MDL_pony_imperials_desc:0 "We are not merely foreign despots ruling over serfs. The ponies of Manedalusia are our brethren, and their soil now forms the heart of the Overseas Dominion. We will offer a claw to anypony willing to share the holy mission's burden, and when we return in triumph, together, we will be of Karthin."
  MDL_total_war:0 "Guerra Total"
  MDL_total_war_desc:0 "Ours is a heroic age; it is an age of steel and fire, of metallic thunder and blood-soaked engines, of marching legions driven by industrial frenzy, an age where war is nothing short of a cataclysmic struggle. To not gear the economy towards war production in this age is therefore purely a folly."
  MDL_veteran_army:0 "Veteranos do Ultramar"
  MDL_veteran_army_desc:0 "Grifo and his fellows came to this land as wet beaked intellectuals, and the Zebrican soil has made of them, as well as the Dominion's army, true soldiers, worthy of Karthinia's legacy."

  MDL_imperial_agriculture:0 "Quotas Agrícolas"
  MDL_imperial_agriculture_desc:0 "The soil of Western Zebrica is harsh, and its myriad farmers and herders need our assistance if they are to provide food for the Dominion's citizens and soldiers. Rather than overburden them with taxes, a flexible system of subsidies and produce quotas will increase efficiency, revenue, ultimately, our supply."
  MDL_imperial_diplo_corps:0 "The Overseas Abroad"
  MDL_imperial_diplo_corps_desc:0 "Access to the outside world's academic institutions is crucial for the Dominion's continued development, and as such, diplomatic missions must be sent abroad to recruit the talent we require and the able bodied creatures our expanding economy needs."
  MDL_imperial_electronics:0 "The Electronic Revolution"
  MDL_imperial_electronics_desc:0 "Just as Industry itself, electronics will revolutionize scientific endeavors and society at large. It is crucial we grant our engineers the funds and materials they need to develop the Dominion's burgeoning electric grid and its myriad supplied services."

  MDL_imperial_magic:0 "Produção Mágica"
  MDL_imperial_magic_desc:0 "Magic crystals hold innate power, which can be channeled to create devastating weaponry that surprasses its purely mechanical equivalents. However, in order to fully take advantage of these encantations, we'll need the technological base to synthesize our own crystal supply."
  MDL_imperial_navy:0 "Armada Imperial"
  MDL_imperial_navy_desc:0 "A suitable doctrinal standard and modernized war vessel models are not merely a cosmetic afterthought to the Dominion's military might. If we are to reclaim Karthin from the barbarians' claws, the newborn Armada will play a role as quintessential as the army itself."
  MDL_subs_tech:0 "Rule The Waves From Below"
  MDL_subs_tech_desc:0 "As sailors of old, the submarine crews endure cramped, claustrophobic and dangerous conditions to travel across the seas, but this new frontier of warfare simply cannot be ignored if the Imperial Armada is to succeed in its missions to come."
  MDL_new_karthin_dockyards:0 "Expand the Drydocks"
  MDL_new_karthin_dockyards_desc:0 "Manedalusia provides a much welcome solid basis for the Dominion's fleet, as well as its bases of support. Rather than draft from scratch the harbors and naval manufactories in whose wombs the Armada's vanguard is to be made, we need simply expand upon the template that's already there."
  MDL_abyssinian_mines:0 "Grant Mining Charters"
  MDL_abyssinian_mines_desc:0 "The mountainous eastern coast and desert interior of Abyssinia is blessed with abundant mineral resources, just waiting for a functional industry to feed. To this end, charters are to be given liberally to New Karthin's syndicates, and we expect results soon."
  MDL_imperial_admiralty:0 "Almirantado do Ultramar"
  MDL_imperial_admiralty_desc:0 "In Zebrica, a new generation of capable navy officers was forged under the Dominion's purview, and they are now ready to serve the Imperial Armada with every ounce of strength, tactical knowledge, and devotion their minds and bodies can give."
  MDL_core_coast:0 "Expand The Heart Of Ultramar"
  MDL_core_coast_desc:0 "New Karthin's direct administration has been largely restricted, but Grifo now plans to invite settlers from Griffonia, and grant funds to Manedalusian ponies, in order to develop the Green Bay's coast around the city and bring it under the Dominion's direct purview."
  MDL_imperial_battleships:0 "The Armada's Mighty Bulwark"
  MDL_imperial_battleships_desc:0 "Though their role in a modern fleet has been downsized in recent decades, a solid core of battleships, with their extensive arsenals, still fill an important role in the navy, and the Armada won't settle for outdated models."

  MDL_imperial_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Modern war is waged on all three dimensions, across all boundaries. No frontier is pointless or unreachable, and no inch of the earth goes unexplored in the effort to gain an edge. Who could ever have guessed, centuries ago, that a mighty Navy could be sunk from the skies above?"
  MDL_mega_based_navy:0 "From The Shores of Zebrica Thou Sailed Away"
  MDL_mega_based_navy_desc:0 "With prowess more than Mortal strength gave\nThou sailed to the Kingdoms of the Lasting Day\nWhat wars thou waged! What seas, what dangers passed\nWhat glorious Empire crowned thy toils at last!"
  MDL_imperial_support_tech:0 "Organize Support Regiments"
  MDL_imperial_support_tech_desc:0 "Are we supposed to forge a worthwhile army out of riflecreatures and nothing else? A modern army needs mechanized vanguards, wheeled and speedy scouts, dutiful medical staff, all the constituent elements that together make a fighting force rise to the occasion of any engagement."
  MDL_imperial_spec_ops:0 "Special Forces Detachments"
  MDL_imperial_spec_ops_desc:0 "Among any army, there are a select few creatures that rise above and beyond the call of duty, whose dedication and skill in equal measure mark them as being a cut above the rest. With specialized training, gear, and little brotherly spirit, these select few can form an elite force the likes of which are unmatched by any standard army regiment."
  MDL_imperial_armor:0 "Singing the Iron Song"
  MDL_imperial_armor_desc:0 "Another wonder of the modern age, an armored regiment can stride through the heaviest hail of enemy firepower relatively unscathed to cut a path for the army's bulk. The Dominion can ill afford such wondrous machines to be outside the purview of our military doctrine."
  MDL_imperial_fighters:0 "Taming the Skies"
  MDL_imperial_fighters_desc:0 "A modernized and well developed air force begins, and often ends, with the bulwark of fighter planes capable of taking and holding air supremacy. It is on that quintessential foundation that all aerial operations, regardless of doctrine, are built, and the Army simple cannot be complete without it."
  MDL_imperial_plane_tech:0 "Innovative Plane Models"
  MDL_imperial_plane_tech_desc:0 "Control over the enemy's skies allows us to damage enemy infrastructure with minimal resistance, while also supporting the rest of the armed forces on the battlefield directly. For these tasks, specialized plane models must be developed and perfected."
  MDL_nonstop_barrage:0 "Neverending Barrage"
  MDL_nonstop_barrage_desc:0 "There are, broadly speaking, two essential roles of artillery on the battlefied: targeted strike, and saturation. For our purposes, the perpetual saturation of enemy lines in a barrage of firepower is the crucial advantage of a fully mechanized army, and we are ready to field weapons fit for such a purpose."
  MDL_project_excelsior:0 "Project Excelsior"
  MDL_project_excelsior_desc:0 "The Gods give onto those worthy the gladius of divine authority, with which they can carve the world into its ideal form. The power of the Atom is that sacred gladius, and it'd be sacriligious not to wield it to that end."

  MDL_integrate_karthin_desc:0 "Through our toils and trials, the Dominion has reclaimed the legacy of Karthinia from the barbarians!

  MDL_core_western_empire:0 "Cartínia Ocidental"
  MDL_core_western_empire_desc:0 "The Western industrialized heart of the Empire has passed claws many times across history, and even the barbarous Aquileians claim territory in its far North. Uniting this land under Karthin's banner will not only entrench our position in Griffonia, it will further solidify our claims to the wider world."
  MDL_core_eastern_empire:0 "Cartínia Oriental"
  MDL_core_eastern_empire_desc:0 "The eastern half of the Empire has seen plenty of bloodshed, conflict and tragedy, and in the depest reaches of their hearts its griffons know the power of their collective spirit, under the guiding light of the Eternal City. With them under the fold, the Empire will be made whole again."
  MDL_reinstate_south_griffonia_society:0 "Restore the Southern Griffonian Society"
  MDL_reinstate_south_griffonia_society_desc:0 "The Imperial Restoration's core was brought together in the old society of South Griffonia, and with the territories of Karthinia being brought under the fold, it is only right we bring back together these disparate intellectuals for the collective benefit of the Empire and its Dominions."

  MDL_industry_of_karthin_desc:0 "Modernity waits for no creature. Time moves on in perpetuity, and now that we've finally seized an industrial base in Griffonia with which we can challenge the barbarians, the time has come for imperial society to enter the modern age with a bang."

  MDL_imperial_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "Clad in the heaviest armor material science can engineer for a land vehicle, bearing cannons that rival the mightiest artillery, a new line of heavy tanks shall be the Empire's vanguard in its holy struggle, an iron fist that no barbarian battleline can possibly withstand."
  MDL_imperial_heavy_fighters:0 "Birth of the Thunderbirds"
  MDL_imperial_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "Roaring engines bring forth a clanking shriek that mimics the noble Falcon, and through the heavens soars a new species of bird of prey, one born in the fires of the industrial age, as harbringer of the Universal Empire, bringing death to the barbarians from above. Such is the purpose of the Thunderbird."
  MDL_imperial_air_doctrine:0 "Imperial Air Doctrine"
  MDL_imperial_air_doctrine_desc:0 "From the disorder of experimentation rises the standardized and methodically calculated doctrine of the Imperial air force.

  MDL_karthin_legions_desc:0 "Above any political notion, the element of Karthinia most crucial to the Universal Empire are its legendary Legions; the Holy Empire's Legions will be modeled in their image, and each creature, from the lowest ranking grunt to the most prestigious commander, will strive to model old Karthin's greatest gift to the world."

  MDL_integrate_asterion_desc:0 "From the Asterionese we take that indomitable spirit of resistance, the will to fight on no matter the odds, to deny Fate its cruel deterministic conclusions.

  MDL_integrate_empire_desc:0 "From the barbarian Herzlanders, we take, of course, the will to claim the divine on this earthly plain, to rise above and command, sword in claw, such that the world's state mimics that of the Heavenly order. And to fully embody this spirit, the line of Griffonstone must carry on in the Holy Empire."
  MDL_integrate_aquileia:0 "Integrate The Revolutionary Soul"
  MDL_integrate_aquileia_desc:0 "From the Aquileians, we take the noble spirit of Revolutionary fervor, the will to shape the world and to bring forth progress ordained by the gods above. It is most fitting that to fully embody this spirit, we reject the aristocratic model of the Karthinian Senate, and construct a new Senate, made in the image of the Republic."

  MDL_integrate_greneclyf:0 "Weavers of Shadows"
  MDL_integrate_greneclyf_desc:0 "The Changelings of the far flung Northeastern isle can provide a very specialized but useful service for the Holy Empire; the most skilled among their number at employing their natural talents should be brought together under our purview to form a secretive agency dedicated to the security of Imperial officials and communications."
  MDL_native_affairs:0 "Assembleias Regionais"
  MDL_native_affairs_desc:0 "Each of the Dominions of the Holy Empire rules over a disparate realm where many local peoples live together, and to enforce a centralized administration from Sacred Karthin is quite foolish.

  MDL_integrate_macawia:0 "The Empire's Austral Bulwark"
  MDL_integrate_macawia_desc:0 "Off the coast of Zebrica, Macawia stands as an unsinkable carrier through which the Holy Empire's power may be projected over North Zebrica and beyond.

  MDL_charting_new_course:0 "Charting The New Course"
  MDL_charting_new_course_desc:0 "Through grit and discipline, we've beaten back the madgriff and his thugs, but the damage to Coltoba and beyond has been immense. As what remains of Manedalusian leadership, the Grandmistress now bears the unenviable burden of choosing how Al-Manedalus may begin to recover from this blow."
  MDL_restore_the_asabiyyah:0 "Restoring Asabiyyah"
  MDL_restore_the_asabiyyah_desc:0 "What holds together Manedalusia is the everpresent solidarity and shared sense of purpose that unites its people. It made us resist Abyssinia's occupation, and will continue to assist us now."
  MDL_get_the_spymasters:0 "Masters Of The Shadows"
  MDL_get_the_spymasters_desc:0 "The spymasters of the Hashm Koltāliba are one of our most reliable weapons, given Manedalusia's weakened state. When facing the enemy head on is unadvised, a dagger in the dark can more than suffice to even our odds. Despite their objections, they must take on direct duties in the Manedalusian army."
  MDL_SAM01:0 "Reach Out To More Zebras"
  MDL_SAM01_desc:0 "Manedalusia's Zebra population is relatively large, but only a select few are ever introduced to the Koltāliba. With the Order properly integrated into the Army, we should strive to expand the recruitment pool from a few outcast zebras to the entire available populace."
  MDL_SAM02:0 "Forge A True Military"
  MDL_SAM02_desc:0 "The first step to establishing Manedalusian military might is to get our hooves on skilled general staff. The loss of the old military council was an utterly devastating blow to our force projection, and it is critical that suitable replacements are found and promoted as soon as possible."
  MDL_SAM03:0 "Rekindle The Manedalusian Navy"
  MDL_SAM03_desc:0 "Once upon a time, the Manedalusian fleet was the pride of the nation, both the source of its prestige and of its wealth. Al-Manedalus cannot prosper without restoring its naval power project to that which is possessed in antiquity."
  MDL_SAM04:0 "Collaborate with Al-Neighzari"
  MDL_SAM04_desc:0 "Much as his presence drives the Grandmistress to rage, it cannot be denied that Al-Neighzari is an ingenious inventor whose expertise will be of great assistance to the Manedalusian Army. His prospects for a magically reloading shell mechanism is of particular interest to us."
  MDL_SAM05:0 "New Methods Of Warfare"
  MDL_SAM05_desc:0 "The Koltāliba are first and foremost warriors and spies, not commanders and generals. But if we are to lead the Manedalusian Army to victory, both the Order's most high ranking members as well as all our officer corps must well versed in this art."
  MDL_SAM06:0 "Protect The City Of Sunlight"
  MDL_SAM06_desc:0 "The Maregyptian Navy is nigh insurmountable to us, and their land army is several times ours' size. We will have to play defensively in order to gain the upper hoof, and that means making sure Coltoba is protected from all possible avenues of invasion."
  MDL_SAM07:0 "Charter Of Rights"
  MDL_SAM07_desc:0 "In accordance with the principle of At-Taqabbul, all members of the congregation are equal under His Watchful Eye. In the same fashion, all citizens of Manedalusia are endowed with both rigths and responsibilities, and their mistreatment by the State is a violation of divine authority. These rights must be recorded and made official."
  MDL_SAM08:0 "Matters Of The Faith"
  MDL_SAM08_desc:0 "At long last, the ash-shuhūd stand united under one polity. As such, the time has finally come to call for a priestly congregation in Coltoba to review the body of Fiqh in its entirety, to settle matters of longstanding contention among our scholars."
  MDL_SAM09:0 "Expand Manedalusian Infrastructure"
  MDL_SAM09_desc:0 "The Golden Coast's unification presents the opportunity to expand upon our existing infrastructure, to modernize the country and truly bring all of the ash-shuhūd together."
  MDL_SAM10:0 "Reclaiming Our Mercantile Legacy"
  MDL_SAM10_desc:0 "Manedalusia's wealth has always been drawn for its participation in international trade. To this end, an illiterate and agrarian populace is an active detriment to the nation's prosperity. An effort to bolster literacy rates will help rekindle the administrative prowess needed to make Coltoba a node of West Zebrican commerce."
  MDL_SAM11:0 "Restore The Merchant Fleet"
  MDL_SAM11_desc:0 "Protecting the Merchant vessels from privateers and looters was one of the tasks for which the Koltāliba were originally assembled. If Manedalusia is to prosper in the new millenium, its primary source of wealth and prestige must be reformed."
  MDL_SAM12:0 "Let The Lion Scratch At Our Walls"
  MDL_SAM12_desc:0 "The Abyssinians continue to eye Coltoba with malice, and we will not sit idly by while they rally their forces to subjugate the city again. Good border fortifications along our already advantageous borders will provide us the definitive upper hoof in the battle to come."
  MDL_SAM13:0 "Assemble The Warrior Hosts"
  MDL_SAM13_desc:0 "We are ready to mobilize the whole of the Order as organized regiments to bolsters the army. It is of critical importance that we continue to develop the Koltāliba methods of warfare in order to build a proper fighting force capable of bringing the fight to our enemies."
  MDL_SAM14:0 "A Unified National Armory"
  MDL_SAM14_desc:0 "Koltāliba weapon stockpiles are largely made up of foreign weapon imports, but our facilities can be easily repurposed into a proper national armory that can help supply the whole Manedalusian army with modernized rifle models."
  MDL_SAM15:0 "Bureau of National Censuses"
  MDL_SAM15_desc:0 "We can hardly be expected to provide for the population's needs without accurate recordkeeping of their numbers. Thankfully, information gathering is Zahid's specialty. A well organized bureaucracy can easily conduct a census and allow us to keep track of all of our citizens."
  MDL_SAM16:0 "Office Of Foreign Affairs"
  MDL_SAM16_desc:0 "Manedalusia is sorely behind the rest of the world's technological and scientific advancement, and this cannot stand. While foreign nations have quite developed academic scenes, what they certainly lack are security measures, especially ones capable of holding back our most skilled spies. So, let us take advantage of this to kickstart our own R&D."
  MDL_SAM17:0 "A Deal They Cannot Refuse"
  MDL_SAM17_desc:0 "Grifo's rampage through the harbor has put guild assets in a precarious position. While we intend to reimburse them fully, this act of good will is done with the understanding that their facilities will be employed to further develop Coltoba and Manedalusia's economy as a whole."
  MDL_SAM18:0 "A New Sun In West Zebrica"
  MDL_SAM18_desc:0 "With the titans of Maregypt and Abyssinia laid low by the Manedalusian Army, we have cemented Manedalusia as one of the most powerful players in all of West Zebrica. We are an oppressed backwater possession of foreign empires no longer; under the All and Ever-Witnessing's guidance, Coltoba is now the shining jewel of the region."
  MDL_SAM19:0 "Deal With Abyssinian Nobility"
  MDL_SAM19_desc:0 "The catfolk of Abyssinia are largely not responsible for Manedalusia's woes, and ruling over them will be relatively easy. However, if Manedalusia is to get back on its hooves and enter the world as a true sovereign nation, we cannot allow slights against our honor to be left unsettled. As such, we will enact righteous retribution upon all those who'd have us made slaves."
  MDL_SAM20:0 "Pacify Maregypt"
  MDL_SAM20_desc:0 "With the Maregyptian state toppled and Coltoba finally secured, we can begin the process of incorporating the whole of the Neighle into a greater Manedalusia."
  MDL_SAM21:0 "Topple The Sphinx"
  MDL_SAM21_desc:0 "Manedalusian sovereignty remains forever under threat as long as Maregypt stands. We will mobilize at once, both to reclaim what is rightfully ours and to bring an end to the hegemony of Somnambula."
  MDL_SAM22:0 "The Hunter Becomes The Hunted"
  MDL_SAM22_desc:0 "Abyssinia's position is far from enviable, and we are now in the perfect position to take advantage of their present weakness. We will not hesitate to crush our former oppressors, and the despots of Panthera will regret the day they dared to oppose Ash-Shahid's faithful."
  MDL_SAM23:0 "Subjugate Yemane"
  MDL_SAM23_desc:0 "Yemane would serve as a useful base of operations in the Arabian Sea, and we see no reason why the Emirate ought to remain independent when integration into the Manedalusian sphere of influence would only benefit us both."
  MDL_SAM24:0 "Bring Braylon Under Heel"
  MDL_SAM24_desc:0 "The historical record speaks unanimously of Asstyria's continual efforts to harrass the faithful in pilgrimage south to Mareakech, and presently, the donkey states' aggression is a nuisance to Manedalusian sovereignty and security. They must be brought under our control."
  MDL_SAM25:0 "Restore The Commissariat"
  MDL_SAM25_desc:0 "Having greatly expanded the Order's numbers, we can now further integrate with the Manedalusian Army by assigning selected members of the Koltāliba to oversee regular regiments."
  MDL_SAM26:0 "Magical Engines"
  MDL_SAM26_desc:0 "Al-Neighzari has provided us with a promising project to coat military vehicles' engines in a self repairing telekinetic bubble. This would greatly improve the performance of all mechanized equipment, and give us a reason to shift production in that direction."
  MDL_SAM27:0 "From The Unlikeliest Of Places"
  MDL_SAM27_desc:0 "The Zebra natives of the Southern borderlands of Marekush show themselves to be quite receptive to Ash-Shahid's Revelations. Zahid believes that great new stock for the Koltāliba can be drawn from among their number."
  MDL_SAM28:0 "Leverage The Maregyptian Navy"
  MDL_SAM28_desc:0 "Our victory over Maregypt provides an opportunity to further expand upon our naval doctrine and incorporate both Somnambula's facilities and methodology into our own."
  MDL_SAM29:0 "Only The Toughest Among Us"
  MDL_SAM29_desc:0 "In the midst of all our reforms, we cannot forget what makes the Koltāliba a cut above the rest: our regimentation. It is of critical importance that all of Manedalusia's special forces are held to this same high standard of training, lest they become indolent and ineffective amidst our expanding numbers."
  MDL_SAM30:0 "Amphibious Warfare"
  MDL_SAM30_desc:0 "Joint sea and land operations are some of the most delicate military endeavors in existence, and require creatures with a level of skill and precision to match. Who better to supply these than the Hashm Koltāliba?"
  MDL_SAM31:0 "An Armored Vanguard"
  MDL_SAM31_desc:0 "Investing in armored vehicle technology will greatly assist the Manedalusian Army in pushing through enemy lines. To this end, funding material science and engineering research to produce mechanized equipment will be an immediate priority."
  MDL_SAM32:0 "Unify The Railway System"
  MDL_SAM32_desc:0 "Our new territories must be connected to Coltoba through rail in order to be properly integrated into the economic system and brought under full control of the capital."
  MDL_SAM33:0 "Leverage Southern Oil Fields"
  MDL_SAM33_desc:0 "While the Golden Coast lacks innate oil wealth, the southern lands of Asstyria and Anseruk have access to productive oil fields that we can make use of to kickstart a Manedalusian oil industry capable of supplying both the civilian and military economy."
  MDL_SAM34:0 "Enforce Standardized Education"
  MDL_SAM34_desc:0 "Having connected the vast swathes of West Zebrica with railways, we can supply schoolhouses from Assur to Somnambula, to assure that all creatures under our purview have access to basic education and are capable of basic literacy."
  MDL_SAM35:0 "A Meritocratic Sultanate"
  MDL_SAM35_desc:0 "The rightful rulers of Al-Manedalus, the scions of Everleaf, were extinguished over a millenium ago, but their legacy must live on through a restored Sultanate. To this end, Manedalusia shall be a non-hereditary monarchy, and the Grandmaster of the Koltāliba shall serve this dual title."
  MDL_SAM36:0 "Modernize The Manedalusian Navy"
  MDL_SAM36_desc:0 "Manedalusia won't settle for cheap, outdated models for its Navy. When it comes to the strike cruisers and destroyers that make up its bulk, we will be at the forefront of technological innovation."
  MDL_SAM37:0 "Manedalusian Industriousness"
  MDL_SAM37_desc:0 "We are not merely a nation of seafaring merchants and desert dwellers. Al-Manedalus always possessed a strong tradition of perfectionist craftsponies. The methods of production have changed drastically with industrialization, but this inner spirit has not left us."
  MDL_SAM38:0 "A Truly Modern State"
  MDL_SAM38_desc:0 "Our conquests have bestowed Al-Manedalus with an extensive population and a developed industrial base."
  MDL_SAM39:0 "Manedalusian Naval Academy"
  MDL_SAM39_desc:0 "To further develop Manedalusia's scientified base to be on par with the wider world, the establishment of a dedicated naval military academy will assist us in assuring our military technology keeps up with modern advancements."
  MDL_SAM40:0 "Manedalusian Grand Admiralty"
  MDL_SAM40_desc:0 "By the grace of Ash-Shahid, we still possess capable naval officers. However, the establishment of an official military rank and hierarchy within the armed forces for the Navy will be necessary in order for them to make the most out of their talent in command of our fleet."
  MDL_SAM41:0 "Fortify The Arabian Border"
  MDL_SAM41_desc:0 "For the sake of Manedalusia's continued security, it is necessary that we erect border fortifications along the edge of the Arabian peninsula, lest the Arabians get it into their minds that we are easy pickings."
  MDL_SAM42:0 "Deal With The Worshippers Of Darkness"
  MDL_SAM42_desc:0 "The Chiropterrans are a perpetual nuisance that we can no longer ignore. Having dealt with our most immediate threats and secured Coltoba, it's time we take the offensive and end the existence of this despicable state."
  MDL_SAM43:0 "Reform The Order"
  MDL_SAM43_desc:0 "If the Koltāliba are to remain as a ruling body for Manedalusia, our secretive and insulated nature must be changed. The Order must become a public facing organization, and part of that process will be to reform our recruitment standards."
  MDL_SAM44:0 "Deal With The Wingbardians"
  MDL_SAM44_desc:0 "The growing threat of Wingbardian colonialism cannot be ignored. If they are not opposed, they are sure to continue spreading and further entrenching their influence in Western Zebrica, putting the Golden Coast under threat. We will expel these invaders for our shores!"
  MDL_SAM45:0 "Monument To Aaliyah"
  MDL_SAM45_desc:0 "The Koltāliba were once slaves brought to the Golden Coast from Zonicia, but the practice of slavery was outlawed by the Everleaf Sultana Aaliyah. As it is to her that we owe our freedom, it is only right we commission a monument in her honor."
  MDL_SAM46:0 "The Grand Sūq"
  MDL_SAM46_desc:0 "One of the most innovative economic developments of ancient Manedalusia, the Sūq pulled investment from far and wide towards our nation. Now that our merchant fleet stands strong, we'll re-establish the Sūq in Coltoba, and hope it will entice foreign investors to come spend their money."
  MDL_SAM47:0 "For The Sake of Peace"
  MDL_SAM47_desc:0 "With the Arabian civil war over and the new government consolidated on the peninsula, it would be wise if we offered them our official recognition of sovereignty and proposed a pact of non-aggression."
  MDL_SAM48:0 "A Preemptive Strike"
  MDL_SAM48_desc:0 "The Arabians cannot be trusted. As far as they're concerned, all of West Zebrica, Manedalusia included, are nothing but a series of rebellious provinces of their empire. We will demonstrate, in no uncertain terms, that we will not tolerate their folly and arrogance."
  MDL_SAM51:0 "The Nightmare Laid Low"
  MDL_SAM51_desc:0 "Our triumph over Chiropterra and their pitiful Legionnaires has proven beyond any shadow of doubt that the Hashm Koltāliba, possessing both the mastery of body and spirit that only Ash-Shahid's faithful can synthesize into a single warrior, are the greatest warriors in all of Zebrica."
  MDL_SAM52:0 "The Golden Coast"
  MDL_SAM52_desc:0 "Though the Koltāliba strive to be freed from earthly constraints and desires, we understand that to most creatures, leisure is a healthy and necessary part of life; and the Manedalusian Coast's natural beauty is more than sufficient to justify a visit, if nothing else."
  MDL_SAM53:0 "Madrasat Al-Bahr Al-Manedalusiyyah"
  MDL_SAM53_desc:0 "A dedicated institution for naval engineering is the last component of a fully modernized military that Manedalusia needs to assure our Navy never lags behind our enemies."
  MDL_SAM54:0 "Naval Depot Network"
  MDL_SAM54_desc:0 "A clever technique we traditionally used to coordinate operations across the sea, by cooperating with local private contractors we can establish independent drydocks all over the coast, even outside the effective range of our major shipyards and bases, to refuel, repair and dock our vessels."
  MDL_SAM55:0 "A New Industrial Nexus"
  MDL_SAM55_desc:0 "Klugetown is one of the most densely populated and heavily industrialized cities in all of West Zebrica. Under our control, it will serve as a jumping off point to continue the economic development of all our major urban centers. There is, of course, the matter of dealing with the mafia that rules over it."
  MDL_SAM56:0 "Refurbish The University"
  MDL_SAM56_desc:0 "The University of Coltoba is an ancient and venerable institution, which once brought prestige and wealth in equal measure to the Golden Coast. Its renovation is of crucial importance to bolster Manedalusia's growing scientific base and keep up with the rest of the world's academic institutions."
  MDL_SAM57:0 "Charter Of The Militant-State"
  MDL_SAM57_desc:0 "Against all odds, despite the madgriff's best efforts, Manedalusia stands tall and independent. Our enemies have been humbled, our nation propelled to modernity, and our people granted the prosperity they deserve. The only thing left to do is for the Grandmistress to formalize a new constitutional state."
  MDL_SAM58:0 "From Behind A Veil"
  MDL_SAM58_desc:0 "It is abundantly clear that ruling over Manedalusia directly is of no productive use to the Koltāliba. As such, it's for the best that we strike a compromise and install somepony who can act as the front facing figurehead of the government."
  MDL_SAM59:0 "A United Sultanate"
  MDL_SAM59_desc:0 "The restoration of the Manedalusian Sultanate has fully restored the Manedalusian people's faith in both the state and in our collective destiny. Coltoba's light is as strong as it ever was, and with all our enemies laid low, may it shine for this new age!"
  MDL_SAM60:0 "A Grand Coronation"
  MDL_SAM60_desc:0 "To celebrate our accomplishments and officialize the Koltāliba Dynasty, Samira shall be crowned Grand Sultana of Manedalusia in a cerimony that will finally revive the Manedalusian spirit for this new age."
  MDL_SAM61:0 "A Coronation Of Shadows"
  MDL_SAM61_desc:0 "Though the Grandmistress may remain as the nominal ruler of Al-Manedalus, it is unbeffiting of her position to exercise power directly. To symbollize the split between the civil and military roles, the coronation of the Sultan shall instead crown the empty throne of the Neighdinat Al-Zahra."
  MDL_SAM62:0 "Officialize The Warrior Caste"

  MDL_SAM64:0 "Stabilize The Territories"
  MDL_SAM64_desc:0 "Our rapid conquests have left the population of Western Zebrica apprehensive, but we'll show them they have nothing to fear. The establishment of a fair and universally applicable code of law divorced from ash-shuhūd law will ease the worries of our extensive population."
  MDL_SAM65:0 "Honors To The Army"
  MDL_SAM65_desc:0 "In this age of industrial warfare, where evert bit of bone, flesh and sinew must fight together or perish all the same, the Koltāliba would never have triumphed over our enemies without the efforts of the regular forces of the Manedalusian Army, for which they deserve full honors."

  MDL_asabiyyah_modifier_desc:0 "Asabiyyah is the Manedalusian term for a people's sense of unity, solidarity, and shared purpose and destiny. The Manedalusians are a people used to hardship, and they take solace in their share faith and sense of group identity. A wise ruler seeks to foster his people's Asabiyyah, while a selfish and foolish one seeks to manipulate it for their own gain.\n\n§YNot all choices are as simple as they seem. The Asabiyyah is a reflection of Manedalusians' very way of life, and should you seek to alter it, always remember that to attempt to mimic Ash-Shahid's divine omnipotence is a grave sin. Serve your people well, and they will do the same to you.§!"
  MDL_federal_army_modifier:0 "The Federal Army"
  MDL_federal_army_modifier_desc:0 "The basis of all morality is duty, a concept with the same relation to the group that self-interest has to the individual; for the Republican State of Manedalusia, duty to the continued existence of the Republic is tied to cizizenship, and given the small nation's relatively tiny population, this has encouraged the creation of a small but elite military force."
  MDL_humbled_sultanate:0 "The Ages of Humility"
  MDL_humbled_sultanate_desc:0 "Manedalusia has spent over a millenium under foreign yoke, being treated as a prize by Maregypt, Abyssinia and Saddle Arabia.

At the very least, we were largely spared the Storm King's destruction."

  MDL_magical_engines:0 "Magically Shielded Engine Blocks"
  MDL_magical_engines_desc:0 "A simple tweaked enchantment allows us to coat a vehicle engine inside a self-repairing bubble.

  MDL_koltaliba_commissars_idea_desc:0 "As is traditional of their role, the Koltāliba have been integrated into our armed forces as a Commissariat, with one member of the Order assigned to all units to serve as a military advisor, commander in the case of emergency or break in the chain of command, and most importantly, as a trainer and inspector to whip the soldiers into top shape."

  MDL_streamlined_tank_production:0 "The Black Guard"
  MDL_streamlined_tank_production_desc:0 "In time immemorial, the Sultans of Everleaf made use of a few select Abyssinian mercenaries for their personal protection. This was the Black Guard, a body of warriors so fearsome and precise that no creature could threaten the Sultan in their presence. In honor of their service in antiquity, the Armor Corps of Manedalusia take their name, and fulfill for the army a similar purpose as the vanguard of any advancement."

  MDL_grand_zoco_idea_desc:0 "The Grand Sūq was originally created by the Majlis Ash-Shūrā during the Golden Age of Sailing to attract investment from wider Abyssinia to Coltoba. It functioned as a sort of stock exchange, where investors could purchase a share of a merchant captain's ship to sponsor his voyages, and then receive a portion of the profits. In its reborn form, it serves much the same purpose, but now also allows investors to sponsor local manufacturing as well."
  MDL_golden_coast_idea:0 "The Golden Coast"
  MDL_golden_coast_idea_desc:0 "The title of Yqur Sapa was the result of mistranslation and cultural confusion; it's a bastardization of ancient Zonician which reached Manedalusia from a series of poorly translated letters from a Colthaginian trader, who greatly enjoyed his voyage to our homeland and affectionately named it the Golden Coast. As a celebration of our revitalization, we've graciously recognized this old moniker, and welcome visitors far and wide. You may travel the world, but nothing comes close to the Golden Coast!"

  MDL_jizya_idea_desc:0 "During the High Sultanate Period, the Sultans of Everleaf implemented the Jizya, a special tax levied on non ash-shuhūd populations in their domain, which was collected on a familial basis. This tax could be paid either as a monetary sum, or, should the head of household decide as such, in the form of one able-bodied creature from the family to serve in the Sultan's Army. Wealthy families that could afford the Jizya could be taxed further, while poorer ones would instead send soldiers to bolster the Sultanate's army; in the rare cases of non ash-shuhūd aristocracy, it was also common for sons and daughters with no expectation of inheritance to be conscripted."
  MDL_gunpowder_empire_idea:0 "The Gunpowder Empire"
  MDL_gunpowder_empire_idea_desc:0 "Al-Manedalus rules its newly obtained dominion through cooperation with entrenched local authorities and a well supplied central army. Sayf is no mindless barbarian conqueror; his domain is kept together through patronage of the arts, protection of trade routes, and stable institutions. He has placed particular importance on a flexible and developed network of railways to connect the far flung corners of his dominion. Manedalusia's rule is cemented by acting as a force for continued progress and industrialization in the region."

  MDL_KAR_shahdom_desc:0 "On the surface, the Crimson Sultan granted the Shahanshah everything he could possibly want; an expanded domain that's entirely under his control, with minimal obligations towards its overlord. In reality, Karkadannistan has been left in a very weakened position after Manedalusian occupation. Having established autocratic rule and demolished the native pony institutions, the Shahanshah is now left with the unenviable task of managing a population that was quite used to their relative political freedom in the realms of Maretonia and Aestlonia."
  MDL_MAZ_vassal:0 "Great Lakes Dominion"
  MDL_MAZ_vassal_desc:0 "The Crimson Sultan gave the Grandmistress of the Koltāliba the arduous task of managing a unified Great Lakes government.

  MDL_federation_member:0 "WZF Member"
  MDL_federation_member_desc:0 "This nation is a constituent member of the Western Zebrican Federation, an international organization conceived for the advancement of constitutional republicanism in Western Zebrica. Originally a far-fetched idea among members of the Manedalusian Majlis Ash-Shūrā, it was brought into being following the young republic's triumph over Maregypt in the reclamation war. The Federation functions in equal parts as a military and economic pact, promoting free trade among its members and allowing for joint operations of their armed forces."
  MDL_KLG_FED_idea:0 "The Federal District of Klugetown"
  MDL_KLG_FED_idea_desc:0 "Similar in concept to an Imperial Free City, rather than being integrated into the WZF as a normal member, Klugetown is an incorporated district that serves as neutral ground for the international assembly. While the city does not have proper representatives in the Federation, this protected status brings great economic benefits to the city, in return for their neutrality; a position that even under the new City Council, Klugetown, having been de facto independent for so long, is very fond for."

Most uniquely, however, it inherently ties the franchise to federal service, rather than to adult age, class or any other status, which makes it one of a kind among these kinds of documents. Though the Majlis took heavy influence from ancient Karthinia when drafting the Constitution, and great effort was put into secularization, certain elements of ash-shuhūd religious law are still apparent, such as the theological underpinning of Liberty being derived from Ash-Shahid."

The position's most important duty is to lead the Federal Assembly during legislative procedure, as well as having the power to veto or approve a motion in case of a split vote.

However, one of their most crucial historical roles since the end of the Sultanate and throughout the Ages of Humility was as assassins and spies. Abyssinian nobility and the Pharaohs of Maregypt would've had a much easier time pacifying the Manedalusian coast were it not for the Koltāliba's efforts to continually foment and foster rebellion, as well as sending their most skilled members to personally dispose of troublesome commanders and political figures.

When they seep into the world, through whatever means, they gather followers deceived by their false powers and wage war against the fabric of Perception itself, seeking to collapse the orderly realm back into the all-encompassing void that spawned them. Though usually confined to irrelevant corners of the world and worshipped by primitive sects, this Demon has deceived the ponies of Equestria that it is their beloved Princess turned Empress.

  MDL_artillery_concern:0 "Maktab Al-Madfa'iyyah"
  MDL_artillery_concern_desc:0 "The so-called Office of Artillery is a surprisingly old institution, originally created as a branch of the Sultanate's Levy command. It was made to streamline conscription of skilled woodworkers and engineers to build siege engines for the Sultan's army. The world has changed drastically since the time the Maktab Al-Madfa'iyyah was created, but its purpose is easily fitted into a modern military doctrine."
  MDL_infantry_concern:0 "Hashm Koltāliba"
  MDL_infantry_concern_desc:0 "Loved and feared, sung and whispered, all across Western Zebrica do creatures speak the name of the Hashm Koltāliba. Officialized as an elite unit of former Colthaginian slaves who converted to the faith in the High Sultanate period, during the Golden Age of Sailing they would be expanded by the Majlis Ash-Shūrā into a fully fledged military force, supplemented with mercenaries, to protect caravans and merchant vessels. The Koltāliba are the most prestigious military organization in Manedalusia, occupying a dual role as both an elite fighting unit, and a commissariat that can be integrated into regular regiments to whip the soldiers into shape."

  MDL_transitional_military_council_desc:0 "Consisting of native Manedalusians that infiltrated the Abyssinian administration, the Military Council is a loose collection of military strongstallions, their loyalist militia forces and the remnants of the occupation garrison, backed by populist leaders and influential economic bussinessponies in Coltoba. Bound together by nationalism and a sense of imminent threat from Manedalusia's weak position, there is nonetheless a heavy, dreadful sense of foreboding conflict as the Council gathers in the reclusive halls of the Neighdinat Al-Zahra; they lack concrete leadership, especially as the nation's direction remains to be decided. If Manedalusia is to survive, this unstable confederation of military and economic interests must be reforged into a true government."
  MDL_council_unstable_trait:0 "Unstable Alliance"
  MDL_velvet_qamar_desc:0 "The story of Harmony in Coltoba is largely the story of Velvet Qamar. As a mare of high culture, Velvet travelled to both Equestria and the Riverlands, being in equal parts a high society socialite and diplomatic envoy. Though initially cooperative with the Abyssinian administration, she would eventually grow disillusioned with the despotic rule of the King and the introduction of slavery in Manedalusia. This would lead her to found the Movement for National Harmony, advocating for Manedalusia's modernization under the principles of Harmony that ponies elsewhere have embraced.\n\nCombining elements of Equestrian governance with traditional Manedalusian clan ties, National Harmony, as she envisions it, is a decentralized system of rule, with majority-elected local representatives and a national assembly balancing urban and rural insterests with proportional representation."
  MDL_sunset_mirage:0 "Sunset Mirage"
  MDL_sunset_mirage_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of April, 979, in Kom Marebo\n\n§YBiography§!: Sunset Mirage is a curious character. Being born in the desert reaches of Kom Marebo, many would assume from her expressed politics that she's nothing more than a backwater hick. In reality, Sunset is an incredibly well travelled and well read mare. In her youth, she was an expressed Hamonite, until she immersed herself in Marksist literature and became an avid anti-capitalist advocate, speaking out strongly against the Mercantile Guild of Coltoba. However, for reasons that no pony is quite certain of, she would eventually renounce Marksism and re-embrace her native faith.\n\nSunset's talent for public speaking has made her the de facto leader of the rural populists in Manedalusia. She leads the Movement for the Advancement of Religious Virtue, advocating for ruralism, social conservatism and wealth redistribution.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Stratophobia"
  MDL_armil_khaldun:0 "Armil Khaldun"
  MDL_armil_khaldun_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of August, 980, in Coltoba\n\n§YBiography§!: Khaldun is one of the few remaining Manedalusians of noble birth whose estate survived to the modern day. As a young colt, Khaldun received a formal education in History and Economics in his native Coltoba, and upon reaching adulthood, he travelled across much of Western and Northern Zebrica as a civilian merchant captain. Though not formally educated in a military academy, his family granted him a tutorship, which would develop his respect for the military life.\n\nHaving a lifelong fascination with his national history, and having been blessed with a knack for rhetoric, Khaldun is now the most popular military officer in the country, his face near synonymous with Manedalusian independence. Khaldun's far fetched dream is to combine the contradictory elements of Manedalusian governance into a single functional body of government.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Stratophobia"

  MDL_crimson_sayf_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of February, 975, in Kom Marebo\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in poverty to travelling beggar parents, Sayf is an unusual face in the armed forces, whose troubled young colts from poor backgrounds are usually born and raised in Coltoba's poorer districts. In his youth, Sayf was severely beaten by a gang of thieves, which left him with a small but noticeable lifelong limp. Though the injury has slowly healed over the years, Sayf still suffers from an everpresent pain in his hind leg.\n\nSayf joined the Abyssinian garrison as soon as he became of age, against his parents' express wishes, always with the intention to eventually subvert the foreign occupiers from within and expel them from his homeland.\n\nOn the personal level, he is an enigmatic figure, both fiercely nationalistic and possessing single-minded religious zealotry. Some would call him brash and unkind, but none would dare describe him as a coward, a hypocrite or a fool; and given his sheer talent and determination to rise to generalship despite his disability, none would underestimate his resolve either.\n\nHis vision for his country is as simple in concept as it is unwavering in its application; a strong, united Sultanate under an absolute monarch, as Al-Manedalus was founded.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Stratophobia"

Always unforgiving and single-minded in his actions, he had never been the kind of pony to give mercy to his enemies. Still, throughout his whole life, he retained a certain sense of honor and fair play, even to those he held in contempt.\n\nThat stallion seems to have died with his colleagues in the January Coup. What remains in his place is a lingering shadow, whose only remaining goal is to enact retribution upon the Abyssinians. Coltoba, Al-Manedalus, his homeland, his people... nothing else seems to matter to him now. All that remains in his eyes is a fiery ember, and the will to carry out a single task: wipe Abyssinia clean from the face of the Earth."

  MDL_fernao_grifo_desc:0 "Not much is known about Grifo, other than he studied in Karthin and was known in Southern Griffonia for being an eccentric bussinessgriff and creative. Politically, he's been known to express a range of inconsistent and ever shifting positions, from revolutionary liberalism, to conservativism, to alignment with the fascist notion of national rejuvenation (despite the mystery of his actual nationality). He has penned a series of political treatises, ranging so widely in content that one would hardly ever expect them to have all been sourced from a single mind.\n\nThe source of his considerable wealth is also somewhat of an enigma, as Grifo is not associated with any family of note, nor with a criminal record. Despite this, he has amassed sizeable sums of money, and has owned multiple properties across Wingbardy, Sicameon and Asterion, though never fully settling anywhere. His arrival in Manedalusia only further confused the matter, as the exact source of his small flotilla is up for anyone to guess.\n\nHaving successfully ousted the Manedalusian nationalists after their hard won independence, Grifo now finds himself in control of a strange state, and given the griff's haphazard political beliefs, it's hard to tell what will come of it. One thing is certain, however: across his whole body work, the one consistent throughline found is the desire for the imperial restoration of Karthin as not merely the old empire, but the Universal Empire, one that transcends old notions of racial and national divides. Equally devoted fanatics have joined him in this endeavor, and one can only guess what this project of Imperial renewal might entail.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Stratophobia"

Seeing no purpose to participating in the family trade, Moonstriker would join the military garrison and serve with distinction for a number of years, gradually building up her reputation among the troops until she rose to generalship.\n\nAmong Manedalusia's general staff, Moonstriker stands out for being the only high ranking military officer that aligns with the Hermetics and their unorthodox views on religious doctrine. As a general, she is known among the soldiers for her single-minded devotion to effective and flexible logistics; through some basic cantrip regimentation among the unicorn troops, Moonstriker makes sure her soldiers always have a surplus of food, ammunition and spare equipment at a moment's notice.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Stratophobia"

Despite this, still inspired by his elder craftsponies, the young stallion always had a fascination with tinkering, which would develop into his admiration for machinery. It is no surprise, then, that now as a general of the Manedalusian Army, Al-Manesūr is one of the prime advocates for the mechanization of the armed forces, believing them to be both the most effective method of crushing enemy forces and preserving Manedalusia's limited pool of willing recruits.\n\nBoth politically and personally, Al-Manesūr is a stallion of the armed forces at heart, and hasn't known any other mode of life in his adulthood. No one is quite sure how or why he suffered the devastating injury that lead to near complete loss of vision in his eye; some believe it to have been an industrial accident, others a fencing injury. Either way, Al-Manesūr refuses to confirm or deny any rumors, and as is his attitude with most things, prefers to leave things left unsaid.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Stratophobia"

Being an orphan for as long as she can remember, she spent her formative years living in the streets and surviving by begging. However, as a young filly, she claims to have received a divine revelation from Ash-Shahid on a cold night, which endowed her with her life's purpose in devotion to the All-Witnessing. Though the Hashm Koltāliba are normally happy to take in orphans like her, she was a bit too old when she was initially introduced to the Order, and so had to go above and beyond to prove her ability and devotion to her peers and then Grandmaster Ali, whom would eventually choose her as his successor.\n\nWhile all Koltāliba are known to be reclusive and prone to few spoken words, Samira distinguishes herself due to her strict adherence to ash-shuhūd practice, from fasting, to daily prayer, in addition to the vows of chastity, sobriety and poverty all Order members make.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Stratophobia"

Most of the experience he's obtained over the years, he got by raiding commercial convoys around the coast of Western and Northern Zebrica, something he became so proficient at that he earned his nickname: the Pirate Gentlepony. There's hardly a single Tobuckian or Hippogriffian shipping company, commercial freighter manufacturer or general seagriff, pony or zebra that doesn't know Astur's name. For his crimes, he would eventually be caught and serve several years in prison in Hippogriffia, after which he made a daring escape by sea and evaded seapony patrols, Chiropterran raiders and other pirates to make his way back to his home in Manedalusia. His years in incarceration hardened him, but also made him repent his miscreant past and return to the faith in shame.\n\nGiven Manedalusia's lack of competent naval staff, Astur's expertise is more than welcome, though he's kept under close watch by other military staff. Astur takes great pride in the fact that over the course of his life, even as a criminal, he always abided by a strict sense of honor; he's never hurt or killed a civilian, nor has he ever attacked an enemy without giving them a chance to fight back, an attitude he's carried over into his newfound career in the admiralty."

Being a young naval officer in the tumultuous years of the first Aquileian revolution, Jean-Claude was initially optimistic about the prospects of pan-griffonian republicanism, but would eventually grow disillusioned and apathetic to the revolutionary movement after the Discret restoration. Somehow, he managed to largely avoid political loyalties among the admiralty and fly under the radar, keeping his opinions to himself, such that he could retire early from the Aquileian Navy with honors and with little in the way of prejudice from his superiors.\n\nDipping into the private sector for the first time in his life, Jean-Claude decided to look for work in the Wingbardian Abyssinian territories, finding modest success as a small investor and working private security for public officials. Despite his successful gigs, Jean-Claude was looking for a stable long-term career, and he knew from the start that he was not a griffon for boring deskwork. It was by a stroke of luck that he would meet Khaldun in the city of Katren shortly after his rise to generalship, and the Manedalusian was impressed by his service record. Jean-Claude did not get the chance to play a big part in the January coup itself, but he is now among the scarce few qualified naval officers in Manedalusia.\n\nOn the personal level, Jean-Claude has an interest in theology and jurisprudence, despite not being a convert to the faith.

Despite her failure, Clover Breeze never lost the love for flight, and she would come to find work in industrial manufacturing in Fillydelphia through her familial connections. It was through her experience working for contractors that she developed an appreciation for airplanes.\n\nHow she came to Manedalusia is something of a mystery, even to herself. A series of bussiness deals and personal connections, each small step leading to another, until she'd eventually land herself a spot in the military council responsible for the small nation's independence. She is somewhat mistrusted by the others, bearing no national ties to Manedalusia and only begrudgingly learning about their religion, but as it stands, Clover Breeze has cut most ties with her homeland and fully put her bets on this young nation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Stratophobia"

  EAW_WS_MDL:0 "[Root.GetNameDefCap] - The Witnesses of Ash-Shahid"
  EAW_WS_MDL_desc:0 "\"To Be is to Perceive; and He who Perceives All holds dominion over all.\"\n- Opening Passage from the Book of Revelation\n\nSome centuries before Luna's banishment, the §YMaregyptian Kingdom§! at that time had been stretching outward, establishing colonial outposts and mercantile bases beyond the barely inhabited desert reaches of the country, nestled along critical nodes of sea travel through the Green Bay. Coltoba was one such city, built in the fairly temperate coast beyond the Kom Marebo as a border fortress and trading post between the heartland of Maregypt and the catfolk of §rAbyssinia§!. For some generations, the city remained as a fairly independent, but still ultimately integral part of Maregypt.\n\nThat would change when a horse from distant Arabia, taking the name of Al-Wallid after his father, came to the port city, emerging from his exile by his older brother. Al-Wallid II subscribed to a very particular interpretation of ancient Arabian religious traditions. He came to the city during a moment of weakness for Maregypt, when its armies could not hope to circumnavigate the desert or travel by sea with a large force to contest him; and as such, he routed the city's garrison with a small mercenary force and conquered it for himself, declaring an Emirate and, eventually, a Sultanate. So was born the ancient and venerable §YHouse of Everleaf§!.\n\nThe §GSultanate of Al-Manedalus§! remained a regional power for a little over a century, and became a near omnipresent economic juggernaut around Western and Northern Zebrica, only topped by contemporary §CKolt-Hadast§!. Unfortunately for the young nation, the last Sultan of Everleaf died heirless in battle against the city of Manephis, believing both that he could take advantage of the destabilized Maregyptian Kingdom's weakness to expand his domain, and convinced the Pharaoh was responsible for the suspicious death of his father. Following his defeat, the coast of Manedalusia was retaken by Maregyptian forces, the Sultanate declared null and void, and Manedalusia's independence extinguished for the millenium that followed.\n\nThe roughly millenium-long period of foreign rule is known to Manedalusians as the §!the Ages of Humility§!; two centuries-long periods of darkness and economic stagnation, though the ponies of Al-Manedalus did enjoy some respite during the §YGolden Age of Sailing§!, when the Kingdom of Abyssinia ruled them as a province. This period was ended when Saddle Arabia took Manedalusia and strangled its profitable trade routes.\n\nIn the wake of Arabia's political collapse and Abyssinia's introduction of slavery into the region, the future seems dire for the Manedalusians, who even after all this time hold on to their religion and culture. What the future holds for this humble city and its wider nation remains uncertain..."
###COLTOBA LORE###
  state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_741:0 "Coltoba"
  state_lore_text_container_state_name_741:0 "The City of §YSunlight§!"
  state_lore_text_container_state_description_741:0 "Coltoba was established as a merchant post by §YMaregyptians§! in the distant past. Though initially an unremarkable trading outpost, its fate would forever change when the Arabian horse Al-Wallid II seized it, declaring a fiefdom that would grow to become §GAl-Manedalus§!.\n\nColtoba itself has always been a mercantile and cosmopolitan place, whose position in the Green Bay and ties to sailing have made it a node for seafaring commerce across all of Western Zebrica; this trading influence would reach its zenith even after the Sultanate was extinguished, as the §rAbyssinian§! Queen Pawkuno delegated provincial authority to the Majlis Ash-Shūrā, a vestigial institution from the Sultan's authority. Through this arrangement, even as a provincial possession, Manedalusia achieved great prosperity and influence; it's for this reason that Saddle Arabia's conquest of the Manedalusian coast, and Manedalusia's subsequent subjugation through the introduction of slavery by Abyssinia has so deeply scarred its inhabitants.\n\nThe city has two beating hearts: its central harbor, and the University. Even as it fell into disuse over the centuries, the Coltoba harbor still remains the central node of activity in the city, operating as a large market for independent captains and local manufacturers, while the §GUniversity of Coltoba§! gathers visitors of the more intellectual persuasion to peruse its open archives. In the rocky mountainous outskirts of the city, the §GNeighdinat Al-Zahra§!, traditional ruling seat of the ancient §YEverleaf Sultans§!, looms large over Coltoba.\n\nHaving been mostly empoverished by the time the §CStorm King§! began his rampage, Coltoba was mercifully spared his wrath, as the Yeti chose instead to pillage the Abyssinian treasury and saw little to take from Coltoba. However, even at its most dire and desolate, Coltoba always possessed one thing that its conquerors could not take away: its natural beauty is nearly unmatched, and the whole of the §YGolden Coast§!, both temperate and always blessed by pleasant sunshine, brings solace to its inhabitants in their darkest hour; the ponies of Al-Manedalus are convinced that even after all this time, the All and Ever-Witnessing watches over them."
